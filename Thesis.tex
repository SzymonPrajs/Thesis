This thesis focuses on the photometric classification and the properties of superluminous supernovae (SLSN), as observed in large astronomical surveys. When working with large samples of transients and a limited spectroscopic follow-up campaign, photometric classifications are the only tool available to select objects which can subsequently be used to study their statistical properties including the rate and its evolution.

I begin by introducing the surveys which produce the transients archive used in this work. I discuss the effect of their properties and design on the work performed in this thesis. I also introduce the sources of auxiliary data, including the spectroscopic follow-up facilities as well as summarise the Dark Energy Survey (DES) spectroscopic sample of SLSNe.

Next, I develop a number of models and techniques used to simulate both core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) and SLSNe. I use the spin-down of a magnetar model in conjunction with spectroscopic UV absorption templates to build \textsc{SLAP}, a tool for simulating SLSN at any redshift, in any arbitrary photometric system. Similarly, I develop \textsc{CoCo} which can be used to simulate and generate the templates for CCSNe.

I then use the tools developed in this thesis to build a definition of SLSNe in terms of the spin-down of a magnetar model and apply it to a sample of transients detected by the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), uncovering one previously unclassified SLSN. I use this and two previously spectroscopically confirmed objects to calculate the rate of SLSNe at z$\sim1$ with the help of a Monte Carlo simulation of the survey. I find the rate to be $91^{+76}_{-36}$\,SNe\,Yr$^{-1}$\,Gpc$^{-3}$, equivalent to 2.2$^{+1.8}_{-0.9}\times10^{-4}$ the rate of CCSN at the same redshift.

Finally, I use the models of CCSN and SLSNe developed in this work as well as the simulations of SN\,Ia and AGN to build a large artificial training sample of DES-like transients to be used in the photometric selection of SLSNe. Based on this, I build a two-stage machine learning photometric classification tool. In the first step I separate SN from other contaminating transients with an accuracy of 99.8\%. Then, I separate the sample of SNe into its individual subclasses, achieving an overall accuracy of 97.85\%. Using complementary selection techniques, I identify 26 new SLSNe candidates in DES.

First of all I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Professor Mark Sullivan, for his fantastic support, mentorship and the opportunities he has given me over the last four years. I thoroughly enjoyed all our discussions, meetings and working together. Even at times when my motivation was lacking, Mark was able to raise my spirit and give me the goals and directions that I needed to get me to where I am now.

I would also like to express my gratitude towards to everyone in the Southampton Supernova group, with whom I had the pleasure of collaborating and sharing my time at Southampton. I would like to specifically single out Mat Smith, who was always there to answer my every small questions and help me with the countless bugs and mistakes made along the way.

Most importantly, I would like to thank my Fianc\'ee Toyah without whom I would have never been able to get to this point. Despite the months of putting up with my long working hours, stress, bad moods and constant complains, she was always by my side and on my side. I could have never wished for a more amazing, loving and wonderful companion and I will always remain grateful for all the help and comfort she has provided me in these last difficult months.
