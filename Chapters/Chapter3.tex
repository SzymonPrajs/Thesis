In this chapter I present the volumetric rate of SLSNe measured using the SNLS data. In order to make the measurement we first had to define what a SLSN is, before searching the survey for any missed objects. We then simulated the survey as precisely as possible, applying the detection efficiency as a function of magnitude into the Monte-Carlo. Finally we did some science about the rate and compared it to the values found in the literature to show that the rate of SLSNe likely scales with the star formation rate of the universe. The work presented in this chapter has been published in \citet{Prajs2016}
