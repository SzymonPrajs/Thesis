\chapter{Rate of SLSNe at z$\sim$1}
\label{Chapter3}
\lhead{Chapter 3. \emph{Rate of SLSNe}}

In this chapter I present the measurement of a volumetric rate of SLSNe at z$\sim$1 measured using the archival SNLS data. First I propose a photometric definition of a SLSN based on the modeling of light curves using the spin-down of a magnetar model followed by a search for missed objects within the SNLS dataset. I briefly introduce the new photometric sample before describing the Monte-Carlo simulation of the survey, aimed at measuring the rate and its uncertainties. Finally, I compare the value measured to those found in the literature and discuss the significance of the result in terms of the physical origin of the objects as well as their detectability by DES and other, future, surveys. The work presented in this chapter has been published in \citet{Prajs2016}.

\section{Defining a SLSN}
\label{sec:SLSNDefinition}
Our first task in the process of measuring the rate of SLSNe was to develop a method for the photometric selection of optical transients that were to enter our SLSN sample. The earliest definitions of SLSNe relied on their peak luminosity and often defined them as SN with an absolute $u$-band magnitude of $M_{u}<-21$ \citep{2012Sci...337..927G}. It was our view that this definition is not adequate for our search for two main reasons. The first was that, already at that time, there existed several examples in the literature of events that are spectroscopically similar to SLSNe, but that do not pass this arbitrary threshold. Some of these events included DES13S2cmm \citep{2015MNRAS.449.1215P} and PTF11rks \citep{2013ApJ...770..128I} which both had M$_u$ > -21 but are also associated with a very slow evolution which is synonymous with SLSNe. The second reasons was the discovery of new classes of fast and luminous transients \citep{2016ApJ...819...35A} with luminosities similar to SLSNe, but with a faster light curve evolution and different spectroscopic types. Therefore, instead of an arbitrary luminosity cut, we use a photometric classification approach based on modeling SLSNe using the spin-down of a magnetar model as a simple analytical model that provides a good fit to a sample of confirmed SLSNe.

This approach did, however, have its drawbacks. Use of an analytical model implied that the rate was calculated only for objects which are similar to the sample of confirmed SLSNe, as presented in \sref{sec:litSample}. We were aware that this would likely not capture all objects of this class at the time this work was undertaken but without a better definition of a SLSN more significant progress could not be achieved. In \cref{Chapter5} I present a more significantly more complex approach to this problem, as applied to DES, based on an artificial training sample of SLSNe and Machine Learning classifiers.

\subsection{Modeling SLSNe}
In order to model SLSN we required two main ingredients: an underlying model for the time-dependent bolometric luminosity of a SLSN, and an SED that can convert this bolometric luminosity into time-evolving spectra. This together forms a spectral series from which we can synthesis the photometry in any desired filter and at any desired redshift. This can then be used for comparison to observed data. For the purpose of this chapter the exact form or the physical meaning behind the light curve model parameters are irrelevant as, in theory, any model that satisfactorily replicates the observables could be used for this purpose. I therefore provide only a brief overview of the model here while the remaining details are described in \sref{sec:SLAP}.

\subsubsection{Magnetar model}
The spin-down of a magnetar model assumes that a collapse of a giant star with an initial mass of M $>$ 40M$_{\odot}$ produces a SNIc like explosion whilst giving birth to a magnetar; a highly magnetized neutron star with a rotation period on the time scale of milliseconds \citep{Kasen2009,Woosley2010,Inserra2013}. The simple toy model assumes a spherically symmetric ejecta and a constant opacity. The free parameters in the model are the Magnetic field, $B_{14}$, spin period, $P_{\mathrm{ms}}$ and the diffusion timescale $\tau_M$ which is directly proportional to the ejecta mass, M$_{\mathrm{ej}}$ and the time of explosion, $t_{\mathrm{expl}}$.

\subsubsection{Fitting literature light curves}
The magnetar model provideded a good fit to all the SLSNe that formed part of our training sample. \tref{table:Magnetar} contains the model's best-fit parameters, as well as two additional derived observables which help us to identify the nature of the events without visually inspecting the light curves. These were the peak absolute magnitude in the SDSS $u$-band filter as well as the rise-time, $t_\mathrm{rise}$, of the SN as measured from explosion to maximum light in the rest-frame $u$-band. It is important to note here that the absolute magnitude, $M_u$, are given in the AB magnitude system. The zero-point correction factor betwee the AB and Vega magnitude system for the $u$-band filter is: $M_u^{\mathrm{AB}}\simeq M_u^{\mathrm{vega}}+0.9$ \citep{2007AJ....133..734B}. Therefore, while some of the training sample have $M_u^{\mathrm{AB}}>-21$, none have $M_u^{\mathrm{vega}}>-21$ which agrees with the previous definition of a SLSN.

\subsubsection{Defing a SLSN parameter space}
\fref{fig:SLAPparam} shows the best-fit magnetar model parameter space. In order to define a region of the parameter space that defines a SLSN we inclosed the cluster of our literature points with an ellipsoid. We chose the lowest volume, simplest geometric body that was consistent with all the SLSN in our training sample. The ellipsoid was defined in terms of the three main fit parameters of the magnetar model, $\tau_\mathrm{m}$, $B_{14}$ and $P_{\mathrm{ms}}$. In the Cartesian coordinate system a position on any generic ellipsoid can be defined using \eref{eq:Ellipsoid}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ellipsoid}
\left( \begin{matrix}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{matrix} \right)
=
\mathbf{A}
\left( \begin{matrix}
R_x\cos(u)\cos(v) \\
R_y\cos(u)\sin(v) \\
R_z\cos(v)
\end{matrix} \right)
+ \mathbf{C}
\end{equation}

\noindent where \textbf{A} is a rotation matrix, \textbf{R} is the radius of the ellipsoid and \textbf{C} is the position of its center. The following conditions must be satisfied: $-\pi /2 \leq u \leq \pi /2$ and $-\pi \leq v \leq \pi$. We have set up our parameter space such that $\tau_\mathrm{m}$ lays along the $x$-axis, $B_{14}$ is along the $y$-axis and $P_{\mathrm{ms}}$ corresponding to the $z$-axis. Using the Khachiyan Algorithm \citep{Aspvall19801,KHACHIYAN198053}, we have performed an analytical fit to determine the ellipsoid that best describes the known population of SLSNe. We found the ellipsoid to have the following properties:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:A}
\mathbf{A} =
\left( \begin{matrix}
-0.184 & 0.575 & -0.797\\
 0.008 & 0.812 & 0.586\\
0.983 & 0.102 & -0.154
\end{matrix} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:R}
\mathbf{R} =
\left( \begin{matrix}
R_x \\
R_y \\
R_z
\end{matrix} \right)
=
\left( \begin{matrix}
1.89\\
2.17\\
11.32
\end{matrix} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:C}
\mathbf{C} =
\left( \begin{matrix}
26.76 \\
2.14\\
2.77
\end{matrix} \right)
\end{equation}

\noindent \fref{fig:SLAPparam} shows the three, two-dimensional projections of this parameter space, populated with our training sample of literature SLSNe.

The SNLS candidates that fall within this parameter space are shown as stars.}

\section{Searching for SLSN in SNLS}
The definition of a SLSN presented in \sref{sec:SLSNDefinition} was then used to classify further objects that were not in our training sample by fitting the magnetar model to those light curves and comparing their best-fits to the parameter space defined by the training sample. In the ideal case we would have first liked to test our definition against a test sample of SLSNe that have not been used in forming of the definition. However, the number of known SLSN events at that time was low enough that we could have not afforded to split it into a training and test samples. We were therefore forced to assume that the parameter space in \fref{fig:SLAPparam} was defined by a representative sample of events. This has further motived us to seek a more elegant and robust solution for any future search of SLSN such as the one performed on the DES dataset in \cref{Chapter5}. I would also like to note that both the fitting method and the definition of a SLSN-like event presented in this chapter does not makes any assumption about the luminosity of the event; making it entirelly possible for fitted events to have $M_u>-21$ and still be classified as SLSNe. Equally, same is true for some events with $M_u<-21$, including those with a relatively short diffusion timescale, $\tau_\mathrm{m}$, giving rise to a faster evolution that is inconsistent with SLSNe. This natural consequence of the technique used here was therefore non susseptable to other classes of luminous (but faster) events \citep{Arcavi15}.

\subsection{Magnetar model fitting}
With the model and definition of SLSNe in place, our next task was to apply the same technique to the sample of SNLS transients. The SNLS detected 4949 transient objects in total \citep{Perrett2010}. This included many objects that were visually designated as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and variable stars, as well as supernovae. In order to perform the fitting on the sample we first has to match each object with a redshift where known. 1694 object in the transient catalogue had spectroscopic redshifts, either from spectra of the transients or of the host galaxy.


As previously described in \sref{sec:SNLSRedshift}, where a spectroscopic redshift is not available, we use photometric redshift estimates. SNLS transients were associated to potential host galaxies by selecting the nearest galaxy within a radius of 1.5''. This provided photometric redshift information on for a further 1527 events. As the photometric redshift estimates are less precise than their spectroscopic counterparts we did not use them directly. Instead, for these transients, we use a range of redshift values spanning the photometric redshift uncertainties. We iterated from the lower to upped uncertainty band in steps of $\Delta$z = 0.04.

At this stage of the analysis we were left with 1728 candidates that had no redshift information. Due to the depth of the SNLS deep stack compare to that of the science images we have expected less objects to be considered 'hostless' as SNLS should have been able to measure photometric redshifts for all but the very faintest host galaxies. We have inspected these objects both visually and using simple statistics. This included the number of detections, number of bands the object was detected in and the separation between detections, and found that a large majority of these objects were in fact likely to be false detections that incidentally matched the SNLS real-time detection criteria \citep{Perrett2010}. Our inspection showed that only 292 of these objects were likely to be real with multiple detections in multiple bands. For these last objects, we have iterated over a broad range of redshifts (0.2 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 1.6 in steps of $\Delta$z = 0.1) but otherwise treated them identically to objects with a known redshift.

Once we have associated every event with a redshift we have proceeded to fitting the SNLS sample using the magnetar model. During the fitting process we have applied the same quality cuts as for our SNLS training sample. We have only accepted objects which had two detections in at least three bands between the best-fit explosion date and maximum light, and a further two detections in at least three filters between maximum light and $+30$ days. For the purpose of this work we considered a detection to be $\geq5$\,$\sigma$ in the real-time photometry. Amongst the 4949 SNLS transients only 2097 had passed our data quality cuts. Their best-fits to the magnetar model are shown in \fref{fig:SLAPparam}.

\subsection{Candidates}
\label{sec:SLSNCands}
As would be expected, and fortunately for us, the magnetar model was not a good fit to the majority of the SNLS objects. A simple $\chi^2$ test was sufficient to remove a large majority of these poor fits quality objects. We have applied a conservative cut at a $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom ($\chi^2_{\nu}$) of 20. We have chosen such a large $\chi^2_{\nu}$ cut in order to retain all SLSNe including these that might be associated with pre-peak 'bumps' \citep{2015ApJ...807L..18N,2015arXiv151103740N,2016ApJ...818L...8S}. Such objects are well represented by the to the magnetar model in the main part of the event, however, due to the extra undulations, their goodness-of-fit is not ideal when taking into account the whole light curve.

Of the SNLS objects that pass our data quality and $\chi^2_{\nu}$ cuts, four lied within the parameter space of SLSNe as defined in \ref{sec:SLSNDefinition}. This included the two spectroscopically confirmed events from \citet{Howell2013} that were part of our training sample. For the other two candidates, SNLS-05D3ks and SNLS-07D3bs, we measured the multi-season light curves using the custom \textsc{PTFPHOT} pipeline (described in \cref{Chapter2}) to allow us to visually inspect the objects and search for signatures of any long-term variability or detections prior to, or sufficiently after, the putative supernova event. This process of visual inspection has eliminated SNLS-05D3ks which showed clear multiple maxima spanning three years as seen in \fref{fig:05D3ks}. This has left us with just a single, new SLSN-like candidate: SNLS-07D3bs.

\label{fig:05D3ks}
\end{figure}

\subsection{SNLS-07D3bs}
\label{sec:07D3bs}
SNLS-07D3bs was identified as a SLSN candidate between $0.6<z<1.2$ based on its host galaxy photometric redshift estimate. The best-fit magnetar model for the object was obtained at z=1.0. While SNLS-07D3bs was never classified or recognised as an object of interest during the life of SNLS, it has been spectroscopically observed on the 17$^{\mathrm{th}}$ April 2007 using the Keck/LRIS instrument. This data was never published officially as no spectral classification was obtained at that time. The data was however presented in a PhD thesis by \citet{2013PhDT.......150F}.

At the time the observations of SNLS-07D3bs were made, the SLSN class was not known and no SLSN spectral templates were available for comparison with the data. The SLSN that have been identified in SLSN by \citet{Howell2013} have also been originally not identified as objects of interest until several years after their initial detection. Using the \textsc{superfit} spectrum identification tool \citep{Howell2005}, we have re-analysed the spectrum of SNLS-07D3bs by fitting all available SN templates at a broad range of redshifts exciting our photometric estimate. The data are noisy (signal-to-noise $\sim$ 7) as observing conditions were quite poor. Despite this, we found the best spectral match to be to the SLSN iPTF13ajg at $z=0.757$ as can be seen in \fref{fig:07D3bsSpec}. While this was clearly an uncertain spectral classification, there was no evidence from the spectrum that the object is not a SLSN, particularly as the best match is an event of that type. The magnetar model also provides a good fit at that redshift as seen in  \tref{tab:07d3bsParams}. The host galaxy, located at RA=14h~21m~50.466s, Dec=+53$^{\circ}$~10m~28.58s, was detected in the SNLS deep stack images \citep{Ilbert2006}, but is very faint, with AB magnitudes of ($u_M$, $g_M$, $r_M$, $i_M$, $z_M$) = ($26.61\pm0.49$, $26.13\pm0.16$, $25.67\pm0.13$, $25.18\pm0.11$, $25.19\pm0.37$). Combining the spectral and magnetar model fitting, as well as a faint host galaxy, matching the properties expected of most SLSNe, provided us with sufficient evidence to consider SNLS-07D3bs to be the third SLSN detected by the real-time pipeline of SNLS.

Weak galaxy emission lines are consistent with $z=0.757$.}

\section{The rate of superluminous supernovae}
\label{sec:MC}
In the previous sections I have outlined our approach to selecting a suitable definition of a SLSN before applied it to a sample of transient detected by the SNLS. This resulted in identifying a sample of three SLSNe including two previously known examples and a new, previously unclassified object; SNLS-07D3bs. In this section I describe the method used to calculate the volumetric rate of SLSNe, $\rho_{\mathrm{slsn}}$, implied by these detections. First, I describe the method used for this calculation and the reasoning behind our use of a Monte-Carlo simulation over a purely statistical approach. I then discuss the reasoning behind our choice of the search volume before presenting the rate calculation and the result.

\subsection{Defining a rate}
\label{sec:method}
$\rho_{\mathrm{slsn}}$ can be defined as a sum over the number of SLSNe, $N$, found in a given comoving search volume, $V$, over a search duration, $t$, weighted by the inverse of the detection efficiency, $\epsilon_{i}$, of detecting each event. This can be summerised using \eref{eq:rate}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rate}
\rho_{\mathrm{slsn}} = \frac{1}{V}\sum^{N}_{i}\frac{(1+z_i)}{\epsilon_{i}T_{i}}.
\end{equation}

The factor $(1+z_i)$ corrects for time dilation. The detection efficiency $\epsilon_i$ is a statistic describing how each SLSN should be weighted relative to the whole population. In other words, $1-\epsilon_i$ gives the fraction of similar SLSNe that exploded during the search period but were missed by the survey due to, for example, search inefficiencies. The detection efficiency is a vital and simultaniously the most difficult part of the computation.

\subsection{Detection efficiency}
The full treatment of a detection efficiency for any survey is a very complex problem with many aspects of the survey to be considered including the cadance, image quality, limiting magnitude amongst other. \citet{Frohmaier2017} shows a recent examples of such comprehensive study performed with the aim of calculating the local volumetric rate of SNIa in PTF. Our SLSN detection efficiencies were based on a similar analysis by \citet{Perrett2010}, who carried out a study of the detection efficiencies and selection biases of SNIa in SNLS, and subsequently calculated a rate of those events in \cite{Perrett2012}. In this study, several million fake SNIa were placed in the SNLS science images, with the correct temporal evolution, and passed though the SNLS real-time detection pipeline. The recovery efficiencies of these SNe Ia could then be estimated. Although these results were produced using a particular model of a particular supernova type, at a more basic level they also provide the recovery efficiencies of point sources in the SNLS data as a function of magnitude in \textit{every} $i_M$-band image that SNLS took, and it is these more basic data that we use in this study. [MAKE A PLOT SHOWING WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR A RANDOM OBSERVING EPOCH]

\subsection{Method}
In this work, we reverse the common approach to supernova rate calculations such as the ones used by \citet{Perrett2012} and \citep{Frohmaier2017}. Instead of calculating the rate of SLSNe starting with the number of detected objects, we instead calculated the probability that a given initial value of $\rho_{\mathrm{slsn}}$ would lead to an eventual detection of three SLSNe in the survey. This method is capable of producing a non-Gaussian uncertainty estimate as a by-product of the calculation as the result is presented in form of probability distribution (\fref{fig:rateFlat3}). We can quote the uncertainties simply as the 1$\sigma$ confidence region of this distribution.

To simulate the SLSN population in SNLS we have used a Monte Carlo approach. We exploded fake SLSNe randomly within the SNLS search period and search volume, and creating artificial SLSN light curves on each epoch corresponsing to the SNLS observations, including the effect of $1+z$ time dilation. As a result we were able to measure the $i_M$ apparent magnitude on each epoch, which was then compared to the point-source recovery statistics on that epoch to give the probability of detection. We have combined all of these individual probabilities to give us an overall detection probability per object.

\subsection{Search volumes}
\label{sec:search-volumes}
The effective SNLS search areas for each field, from which the search volumes can be calculated, was found accurately in \citet{2012AJ....144...59P} giving an effective total search area of 3.56\,deg$^2$. The volume was calculated by considering the redshift range to which our search was sensitive. The four observing fields cannot all be considered as identical there are small variation in the detection efficiency amongst the fields. The observing season in the D3 field was longer in comparison to the other fields while D1 and D2 had on average, marginally deeper exposures.

At the low-redshift end, the search volume was set by the redshift at which a SLSN would become saturated in the SNLS data. At the high-redshift end, the volume was set by the redshift at which we are no longer able to recover a SLSN event, i.e. a SLSN would fall below the detection limit of the survey. \fref{fig:zrange} illustrates the redshift range to which the search for SLSNe was sensitive to in SNLS, showing the recovery efficiency as a function of redshift for the three events identified in \sref{sec:SLSNCands}. For events at z$<$0.2, the efficiency droped rapidly due to saturation effects setting z = 0.2 as the lower redshift limit. At the upper redshift limit, we choose z = 1.6. Although some events similar to SNLS-06D4eu were detectable at z > 2, the fainter events like SNLS-07D3ds would have become undetectable in some of the SNLS search fields at z $<$ 1.6.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/Chapter3/Efficiency}
\caption{The redshift range to which our SLSN search was sensitive to, as a function of the four SNLS search fields. The figure shows the recovery efficiency of three different SLSNe as a function of redshift, with each line corresponding to a different search field. The efficiency includes the same data quality cuts as used in the training sample in \sref{sec:Definition} and the SNLS candidate selection in \sref{sec:SLSNCands}. The vertical dashed lines at z = 0.2 and z = 1.6 illustrate the final redshift range used in our Monte Carlo rate calculations.}
\label{fig:zrange}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Monte Carlo simulation}
\label{sec:rate-calculation}
We begun each Monte Carlo simulation with an input $\rho_{\mathrm{slsn}}$ value. From this we calculated the number of SLSNe that would have occurred within the SNLS search area over the redshift range to which we are sensitive ($0.2<\mathrm{z}<1.6$) in bins of $\Delta$z = 0.01. We assumed that this rate does not evolve within the redshift range which we consider in our simulation, however, we test a rate that follows the star formation rate of the universe in \sref{sec:SFRRate}. The artificial SLSNe were then assigned a random spatial position (and consequent Milky Way extinction), redshift, host galaxy extinction and physical parameters drawn from the magnetar model parameter space derived from our training sample (\fref{fig:SLAPparam}). A random explosion epoch during the SNLS search period was assigned to each event. From this the synthetic photometry was calculated on every epoch corresponding to a SNLS observation.

Using the point-source detection efficiencies of \cite{Perrett2010}, we then calculated the probability of detecting each SLSN on every epoch of $i_M$ data, and combine the probabilities to give the total probability of discovering each object. In order to be considered detected, we also enforce that each artificial SLSN must pass the same data quality cuts as both our training sample in \sref{sec:Definition} and our real sample of SNLS candidates in \sref{sec:SLSNCands}. We have repeated the entire simulation 100,000 times over an input $\rho_{\mathrm{slsn}}$ range of $5 \leq \rho_{\mathrm{slsn}} \leq 500$\,SNe\,Yr$^{-1}$\,Gpc$^{-3}$.

\fref{fig:rateFlat3} shows the probability of three SLSN events being detected in our simulations as a function of this input rate. A log-normal distribution was fitted to the simulation results and used to smoothly determine the peak of the distribution as well as the 1$\sigma$ confidence regions. From this, we have found the rate of SLSNe at z = 1.13, which was the volume-weighted centre of the 0.2 $<$ z $<$ 1.6 range, to be $\rho_{\mathrm{slsn}} = 91^{+76}_{-36}$\,SNe\,Yr$^{-1}$\,Gpc$^{-3}$.

\subsection{Rate assuming a SFR distribution of SLSN}
\label{sec:SFRRate}
As SLSN are a likely consequence of a collapse of a giant, short lived star it is expected that the rate of SLSNe should follow closely to that of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR). An expected consequence of this would be that a larger proportion of SLSNe would be found at high redshift than if we assumed a non-evolving population. We have investigated the consequence of this effect have on our final rate. We have repeated the Monte Carlo simulation, but instead drew the SLSNe from a redshift distribution that follows the cosmic star-formation history as taken from \citet{2006ApJ...651..142H} and described in more details in \sref{sec:ConclusionsSFR}. For the value pivoted at z=1.13, as in the case of the flat distribution, we found $\rho_{\mathrm{slsn}} = 98^{+82}_{-39}$\,SNe\,Yr$^{-1}$\,Gpc$^{-3}$. This was very close to our original result and, considering the uncertainities, a negligible difference. Thus our final rate, averaged over the redshift range we have considered, was not sensitive to the assumed rate evolution in our simulation. One possible explanation of this is that the relative uniformity of our detection efficiency as a function of redshift within our search volume has negated the effects of the redshift evolution (\fref{fig:zrange}).
