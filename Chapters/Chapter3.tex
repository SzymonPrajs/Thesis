\chapter{Rate of SLSNe at z$\sim$1} 
\label{Chapter3}
\lhead{Chapter 3. \emph{Rate of SLSNe}} 

In this chapter I present the volumetric rate of SLSNe at z$\sim$1, measured from the archival SNLS data, and all steps required to perform the calculation. First I propose a definition of a SLSN based on the modeling of light curves using the spin-down of a magnetar model followed by a photometric search for missed objects within the SNLS dataset. I briefly introduce the photometric sample of SLSNe discovered in SNLS before describing the Monte-Carlo simulation of the survey, aimed at measuring the rate and its uncertainties. Finally, I compare the value measured to those found in the literature and discuss the significance of the result in terms of the physical origin of the objects as well as their detectability by DES and other, future, surveys. The work presented in this chapter has been published in \citet{Prajs2016}.
