In this chapter I discuss the data, surveys and the follow-up facilities used in this thesis. I begin by describing the sample of published SLSNe used as a baseline dataset throughout this work. I then describe the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) which are the surveys that provided all transient candidates analyzed in this work. Finally we overview the follow-up facilities that provided the classifications and other axillary information about the transients analysed in this work.
