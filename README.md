_University of Southampton Thesis Templates_

Put on GitHub by Rob E. Firth (https://github.com/RobFirth / www.southampton.ac.uk/~ref1g12 ).

The Thesis template file `Thesis.cls', is based on 'ECSthesis.cls', by Steve R. Gunn
generated with the docstrip utility.
Created by Steve R. Gunn, modified by Sunil Patel: www.sunilpatel.co.uk

Further (very minor) modifications by R. Firth: https://github.com/RobFirth
including:
 - Added some useful docs
 - Rearranged Thesis.tex to be in the right order for a University of Southampton submission
 - Added some further tweaks I found useful - single spacing the abstract etc.
 
Information about submission etc can be found here:
