abstract = {We investigate the light-curve properties of a sample of 26 spectroscopically confirmed hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) survey. These events are brighter than SNe Ib/c and SNe Ic-BL, on average by about 4 and 2 mag, respectively. The SLSNe-I peak absolute magnitudes in rest-frame {\$}g{\$}-band span {\$}-22\backslashlesssim M{\_}g \backslashlesssim-20{\$} mag, and these peaks are not powered by radioactive {\$}{\^{}}{\{}56{\}}{\$}Ni, unless strong asymmetries are at play. The rise timescales are longer for SLSNe than for normal SNe Ib/c, by roughly 10 days, for events with similar decay times. Thus, SLSNe-I can be considered as a separate population based on a photometric criterion. After peak, SLSNe-I decay with a wide range of slopes, with no obvious gap between rapidly-declining and slowly-declining events. The latter events show more irregularities (bumps) in the light curves at all times. At late times the SLSN-I light curves slow down and cluster around the {\$}{\^{}}{\{}56{\}}{\$}Co radioactive decay rate. Powering the late-time light curves with radioactive decay would require between 1 and 10 {\$}{\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} of Ni masses. Alternatively, a simple magnetar model can reasonably fit the majority of SLSNe-I light curves, with three exceptions, and can mimic the radioactive decay of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}56{\}}{\$}Co, up to {\$}\backslashsim400{\$} days from explosion. The resulting spin values do not correlate with the host-galaxy metallicities. Finally, the analysis of our sample cannot strengthen the case for using SLSNe-I for cosmology.},

abstract = {We report extensive observational data for five of the lowest redshift Super-Luminous Type Ic Supernovae (SL-SNe Ic) discovered to date, namely PTF10hgi, SN2011ke, PTF11rks, SN2011kf and SN2012il. Photometric imaging of the transients at +50 to +230 days after peak combined with host galaxy subtraction reveals a luminous tail phase for four of these SL-SNe. A high resolution, optical and near infrared spectrum from xshooter provides detection of a broad He I $\lambda$10830 emission line in the spectrum (+50d) of SN2012il, revealing that at least some SL-SNe Ic are not completely helium free. At first sight, the tail luminosity decline rates that we measure are consistent with the radioactive decay of 56 Co, and would require 1-4 M ⊙ of 56 Ni to produce the luminosity. These 56 Ni masses cannot be made consistent with the short diffusion times at peak, and indeed are insufficient to power the peak luminosity. We instead favour energy deposition by newborn magnetars as the power source for these objects. A semi-analytical diffusion model with energy input from the spin-down of a magnetar reproduces the extensive lightcurve data well. The model predictions of ejecta velocities and temperatures which are required are in reasonable agreement with those determined from our observations. We derive magnetar energies of 0.4 E(10 51 erg) 6.9 and ejecta masses of 2.3 M ej (M ⊙) 8.6. The sample of five SL-SNe Ic presented here, combined with SN 2010gx -the best sampled SL-SNe Ic so far -point toward an explosion driven by a magnetar as a viable explanation for all SL-SNe Ic.

abstract = {We present optical spectra and light curves for three hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae followed by the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO). Time series spectroscopy from a few days after maximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class, with spectra dominated by Ca II, Mg II, Fe II and Si II, which evolve slowly over most of the post-peak photospheric phase. We determine bolometric light curves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy input by magnetar spin-down, 56Ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaque circumstellar shell. We investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of our sample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain the possible mechanisms behind these events. We have followed these events to beyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fading supernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diverse behaviour at this phase. Models powered by radioactivity require unrealistic parameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previous studies. Both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to be viable candidates. A large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phase luminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapid drop in flux. This would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, or that the X-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. The light curve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d after maximum light. We argue that this could result either from multiple shells of circumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of the ejecta.},

abstract = {Pan-STARRS is a highly cost-effective, modular and scalable approach to wide-field optical/NIR imaging. It uses 1.8m telescopes with very large (7 square degree) field of view and revolutionary1.4 billion pixel CCD cameras with low noise and rapid read-out to provide broad-band imaging from 400-1000nm wavelength. The first single telescope system, PS1, has been deployed on Haleakala on Maui, and has been collecting science quality survey data for approximately six months. PS1 will be joined by a second telescope PS2 in approximately 18 months. A four aperture system is planned to become operational following the end of the PS1 mission. This will be able to scan the entire visible sky to approximately 24th magnitude in less than a week, thereby meeting the goals set out by the NAS 2000 decadal review for a "Large Synoptic Sky Telescope". Here we review the technical design, and give an update on the progress that has been made with the PS1 system.},

abstract = {We present distance measurements to 71 high redshift type Ia supernovae discovered during the first year of the 5-year Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). These events were detected and their multi-color light-curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshift. With this data set, we have built a Hubble diagram extending to z=1, with all distance measurements involving at least two bands. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated making use of the multi-band photometry obtained at CFHT. Cosmological fits to this first year SNLS Hubble diagram give the following results : Omega{\_}M = 0.263 +/- 0.042(stat) +/- 0.032(sys) for a flat LambdaCDM model; and w = -1.023 +/- 0.090(stat) +/- 0.054(sys) for a flat cosmology with constant equation of state w when combined with the constraint from the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations.},

abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a fully-automated, wide-field survey aimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. The transient survey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory; colors and light curves for detected transients are obtained with the automated Palomar 60-inch telescope. PTF uses eighty percent of the 1.2-m and fifty percent of the 1.5-m telescope time. With an exposure of 60-s the survey reaches a depth of approximately 21.3 in g' and 20.6 in R (5 sigma, median seeing). Four major experiments are planned for the five-year project: 1) a 5-day cadence supernova search; 2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 seconds and 1 day; 3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in Orion; and 4) a 3-pi sr deep H-alpha survey. PTF provides automatic, realtime transient classification and follow up, as well as a database including every source detected in each frame. This paper summarizes the PTF project, including several months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, the observing plans and the data reduction strategy. We conclude by detailing the first 51 PTF optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.},

abstract = {Supernovae (SNe) are popular tools to explore the cosmological expansion of the Universe owing to their bright peak magnitudes and reasonably high rates; however, even the relatively homogeneous Type Ia supernovae are not intrinsically perfect standard candles. Their absolute peak brightness must be established by corrections that have been largely empirical. Hundreds of SNe are now found every year, shrinking the statistical errors in the cosmological parameters, but most of these distant discoveries do little to further the physical understanding of SNe, which could illuminate unknown systematics. The Texas Supernova Search was not designed to discover the most SNe nor the most distant SNe, but it was instead created to amass a small collection of well-observed nearby SNe with detailed, multi-epoch spectral observations beginning at the earliest possible phases. For the past two years, I have pointed ROTSE-IIIb's 1.85 X 1.85 degree field of view at nearby galaxy clusters and searched thousands of galaxies, covering hundreds of square degrees on the sky, for supernovae. With ToO time on the neighboring 9.2m Hobby-Eberly Telescope, the search has captured SNe spectra at some of the earliest phases ever. In this dissertation I describe the Texas Supernova Search and present the 30 supernovae, 11 novae, and 6 dwarf novae discovered in the first two years of the program.},

abstract = {We report on the discovery and observations of the extremely luminous optical transient CSS100217:102913+404220 (CSS100217 hereafter). Spectroscopic observations show this transient was coincident with a galaxy at redshift z=0.147, and reached an apparent magnitude of V {\~{}} 16.3. After correcting for foreground Galactic extinction we determine the absolute magnitude to be M{\_}V =-22.7 approximately 45 days after maximum light. Based on our unfiltered optical photometry the peak optical emission was L = 1.3 x 10{\^{}}45 erg s{\^{}}-1, and over a period of 287 rest-frame days had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 1.2 x 10{\^{}}52 erg. Analysis of the pre-outburst SDSS spectrum of the source shows features consistent with a Narrow-line Seyfert1 (NLS1) galaxy. High-resolution HST and Keck followup observations show the event occurred within 150pc of nucleus of the galaxy, suggesting a possible link to the active nuclear region. However, the rapid outburst along with photometric and spectroscopic evolution are much more consistent with a luminous supernova. Line diagnostics suggest that the host galaxy is undergoing significant star formation. We use extensive follow-up of the event along with archival CSS and SDSS data to investigate the three most likely sources of such an event; 1) an extremely luminous supernova; 2) the tidal disruption of a star by the massive nuclear black hole; 3) variability of the central AGN. We find that CSS100217 was likely an extremely luminous type IIn supernova that occurred within range of the narrow-line region of an AGN. We discuss how similar events may have been missed in past supernova surveys because of confusion with AGN activity.},

abstract = {We report the discovery and early observations of the peculiar Type IIn supernova (SN) 2006gy in NGC 1260. With a peak visual magnitude of about -22, it is the most luminous supernova ever recorded. Its very slow rise to maximum took {\~{}}70 days, and it stayed brighter than -21 mag for about 100 days. It is not yet clear what powers the enormous luminosity and the total radiated energy of {\~{}}1051 erg, but we argue that any known mechanism—thermal emission, circumstellar interaction, or 56Ni decay—requires a very massive progenitor star. The circumstellar interaction hypothesis would require truly exceptional conditions around the star, which, in the decades before its death, must have experienced a luminous blue variable (LBV) eruption like the 19th century eruption of $\eta$ Carinae. However, this scenario fails to explain the weak and unabsorbed soft X-rays detected by Chandra. Radioactive decay of 56Ni may be a less objectionable hypothesis, but it would imply a large Ni mass of {\~{}}22 M☉, requiring SN 2006gy to have been a pair-instability supernova where the star's core was obliterated. While this is still uncertain, SN 2006gy is the first supernova for which we have good reason to suspect a pair-instability explosion. Based on a number of lines of evidence, we eliminate the hypothesis that SN 2006gy was a ``Type IIa'' event, that is, a white dwarf exploding inside a hydrogen envelope. Instead, we propose that the progenitor was a very massive evolved object like $\eta$ Carinae that, contrary to expectations, failed to shed its hydrogen envelope. SN 2006gy implies that some of the most massive stars can explode prematurely during the LBV phase, never becoming Wolf-Rayet stars. SN 2006gy also suggests that they can create brilliant supernovae instead of experiencing ignominious deaths through direct collapse to a black hole. If such a fate is common among the most massive stars, then observable supernovae from Population III stars in the early universe will be more numerous than previously believed.},

A temporal series of high-resolution optical spectra of the SN Ia PTF 11kx reveals a complex circumstellar environment that provides an unprecedentedly detailed view of the progenitor system.

abstract = {The ejected mass distribution of type Ia supernovae directly probes progenitor evolutionary history and explosion mechanisms, with implications for their use as cosmological probes. Although the Chandrasekhar mass is a natural mass scale for the explosion of white dwarfs as type Ia supernovae, models allowing type Ia supernovae to explode at other masses have attracted much recent attention. Using an empirical relation between the ejected mass and the light curve width, we derive ejected masses {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}ej{\}}{\$} and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}56{\}}{\$}Ni masses {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}Ni{\}}{\$} for a sample of 337 type Ia supernovae with redshifts {\$}z {\textless} 0.7{\$} used in recent cosmological analyses. We use hierarchical Bayesian inference to reconstruct the joint {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}ej{\}}{\$}-{\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}Ni{\}}{\$} distribution, accounting for measurement errors. The inferred marginal distribution of {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}ej{\}}{\$} has a long tail towards sub-Chandrasekhar masses, but cuts off sharply above 1.4 {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. Our results imply that 25$\backslash${\%}-50$\backslash${\%} of normal type Ia supernovae are inconsistent with Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, with almost all of these being sub-Chandrasekhar-mass; super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions make up no more than 1$\backslash${\%} of all spectroscopically normal type Ia supernovae. We interpret the type Ia supernova width-luminosity relation as an underlying relation between {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}ej{\}}{\$} and {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}Ni{\}}{\$}, and show that the inferred relation is not naturally explained by the predictions of any single known explosion mechanism.},

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {Multiple observational lines of evidence support a connection between hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Both events require a powerful central energy source, usually attributed to a millisec-ond magnetar or an accreting black hole. The GRB-SLSN link raises several theoretical questions: What distinguishes the engines responsible for these different phenomena? Can a single engine power both a GRB and a luminous SN in the same event? We propose a new unifying model for magnetar thermalization and jet formation: mis-alignment between the rotation (Ω) and magnetic dipole (µ) axes thermalizes a frac-tion of the spindown power by reconnection in the striped equatorial wind, providing a guaranteed source of " thermal " emission to power the supernova. The remaining un-thermalized power energizes a relativistic jet. In this picture, the GRB-SLSN di-chotomy is directly linked to Ω {\textperiodcentered} µ through the misalignment angle $\alpha$, such that the thermal fraction is 1.025$\alpha$/ 0.636 + $\alpha$ 4 1/4 . We extend earlier work to show that even weak relativistic jets of luminosity ∼ 10 46 erg s −1 can escape the expanding SN ejecta hours after the explosion — whether driven by a magnetar or black hole accretion — implying that escaping relativistic jets may accompany many SLSNe regardless of the details of their driving mechanism. We calculate the observational signature of these jets. We show that they may produce transient UV cocoon emission lasting a few hours when the jet breaks out of the ejecta surface. A longer-lived optical/UV signal may originate from a mildly-relativistic wind driven from the interface between the jet and the ejecta walls. This provides a new explanation for the secondary early-time maximum observed in some SLSNe light curves, such as LSQ14bdq. This scenario also predicts a population of GRB from on-axis jets with extremely long durations, potentially similar to the population of " jetted tidal disruption events " , in coincidence with a small subset of SLSNe.},

abstract = {For decades optical time-domain searches have been tuned to find ordinary supernovae, which rise and fall in brightness over a period of weeks. Recently, supernova searches have improved their cadences and a handful of fast-evolving luminous transients (FELTs) have been identified. FELTs have peak luminosities comparable to Type Ia supernovae, but rise to maximum in {\$}{\textless}10{\$} days and fade from view in {\$}{\textless}{\$}month. Here we present the most extreme example of this class thus far, KSN2015K, with a rise time of only 2.2 days and a time above half-maximum ({\$}t{\_}{\{}1/2{\}}{\$}) of only 6.8 days. Here we show that, unlike Type Ia supernovae, the light curve of KSN2015K was not powered by the decay of radioactive elements. We further argue that it is unlikely that it was powered by continuing energy deposition from a central remnant (a magnetar or black hole). Using numerical radiation hydrodynamical models, we show that the light curve of KSN2015K is well fit by a model where the supernova runs into external material presumably expelled in a pre-supernova mass loss episode. The rapid rise of KSN2015K therefore probes the venting of photons when a hypersonic shock wave breaks out of a dense extended medium.},

@article{Drout2014,
abstract = {In the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discovered whose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditional supernovae (SN) models. The sample size of these objects has remained small due, at least in part, to the challenges of detecting short timescale transients with traditional survey cadences. Here we present the results from a search within the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS) for rapidly-evolving and luminous transients. We identify 10 new transients with a time above half-maximum (t 1/2) of less than 12 days and −16.5 {\textgreater} M {\textgreater} −20 mag. This increases the number of known events in this region of SN phase space by roughly a factor of three. The median redshift of the PS1-MDS sample is z=0.275 and they all exploded in star forming galaxies. In general, the transients possess faster rise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g P1 − r P1 −0.2). Best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/cool with time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by a blue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. We find it difficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (L {\textgreater} 10 43 erg s −1), and lack of UV line blanketing observed in many of these transients with an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of 56 Ni. Rather, we find that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission from the explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected very little ({\textless}0.03 M ⊙) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within a dense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. After calculating the detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the PS1-MDS we find a volumetric rate of 4800 − 8000 events yr −1 Gpc −3 (4 − 7{\%} of the core-collapse SN rate at z=0.2).},

abstract = {The time lag between optical and near-infrared continuum emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) shows a tight correlation with luminosity and has been proposed as a standardisable candle for cosmology. In this paper, we explore the use of these AGN hot-dust time lags for cosmological model fitting under the constraints of the new VISTA Extragalactic Infrared Legacy Survey VEILS. This new survey will target a 9 deg{\^{}}2 field observed in J- and Ks-band with a 14-day cadence and will run for three years. The same area will be covered simultaneously in the optical griz bands by the Dark Energy Survey, providing complementary time-domain optical data. We perform realistic simulations of the survey setup, showing that we expect to recover dust time lags for about 450 objects out of a total of 1350 optical type 1 AGN, spanning a redshift range of 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2. We use the lags recovered from our simulations to calculate precise distance moduli, establish a Hubble diagram, and fit cosmological models. Assuming realistic scatter in the distribution of the dust around the AGN as well as in the normalisation of the lag-luminosity relation, we are able to constrain {\{}$\backslash$Omega{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}} in {\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}}CDM with similar accuracy as current supernova samples.

abstract = {We investigate the light-curve properties of a sample of 26 spectroscopically confirmed hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) survey. These events are brighter than SNe Ib/c and SNe Ic-BL, on average by about 4 and 2 mag, respectively. The SLSNe-I peak absolute magnitudes in rest-frame g-band span −22 M g −20 mag, and these peaks are not powered by radioactive 56 Ni, unless strong asymmetries are at play. The rise timescales are longer for SLSNe than for normal SNe Ib/c, by roughly 10 days, for events with similar decay times. Thus, SLSNe-I can be considered as a separate population based on a photometric criterion. After peak, SLSNe-I decay with a wide range of slopes, with no obvious gap between rapidly-declining and slowly-declining events. The latter events show more irregularities (bumps) in the light curves at all times. At late times the SLSN-I light curves slow down and cluster around the 56 Co radioactive decay rate. Powering the late-time light curves with radioactive decay would require between 1 and 10 M ⊙ of Ni masses. Alternatively, a simple magnetar model can reasonably fit the majority of SLSNe-I light curves, with three exceptions, and can mimic the radioactive decay of 56 Co, up to ∼ 400 days from explosion. The resulting spin values do not correlate with the host-galaxy metallicities. Finally, the analysis of our sample cannot strengthen the case for using SLSNe-I for cosmology.},

We assemble a homogeneous sample of previously classified SLSNe I from the literature, and fit their light curves using Gaussian processes. From the fits, we identify four pho-tometric parameters that have a high statistical significance when correlated, and combine them in a parameter space that conveys information on their luminosity and color evolution. This parameter space presents a new definition for SLSNe I, which can be used to analyse existing and future transient datasets. We find that 90{\%} of previously classified SLSNe I meet our new definition. We also examine the evidence for two subclasses of SLSNe I, combining their photo-metric evolution with spectroscopic information, namely the photospheric velocity and its gradient. A cluster analysis reveals the presence of two distinct groups. 'Fast' SLSNe show fast light curves and color evolution, large velocities, and a large velocity gradient. 'Slow' SLSNe show slow light curve and color evolution, small expansion velocities, and an almost non-existent velocity gradient. Finally, we discuss the impact of our analyses in the understanding of the powering engine of SLSNe, and their implementation as cosmological probes in current and future surveys.},

abstract = {In the era of large astronomical surveys, photometric classification of supernovae (SNe) has become an important research field due to limited spectroscopic resources for candidate follow-up and classification. In this work, we present a method to photometrically classify type Ia supernovae based on machine learning with redshifts that are derived from the SN light-curves. This method is implemented on real data from the SNLS deferred pipeline, a purely photometric pipeline that identifies SNe Ia at high-redshifts (0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.1). Our method consists of two stages: feature extraction (obtaining the SN redshift from photometry and estimating light-curve shape parameters) and machine learning classifica-tion. We study the performance of different algorithms such as Random Forest and Boosted Decision Trees. We evaluate the performance using SN simulations and real data from the first 3 years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), which contains large spectroscopically and photometrically classified type Ia samples. Using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, where perfect classification is given by 1, we find that our best-performing classifier (Extreme Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) has an AUC of 0.98. We show that it is possible to obtain a large photometrically selected type Ia SN sample with an estimated contamination of less than 5{\%}. When applied to data from the first three years of SNLS, we obtain 529 events. We investigate the differences between classifying simulated SNe, and real SN survey data. In particular, we find that applying a thorough set of selection cuts to the SN sample is essential for good classification. This work demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of machine learning classification in a high-z SN survey with application to real SN data.},

We applied it to our observing runs of Subaru-HSC in 2015 May and August, and proved it to be efficient in selecting optical transients. The false positive rate was 1.0{\%} at the true positive rate of 90{\%} in the magnitude range of 22.0–25.0 mag for the former data. For the latter run, we successfully detected and reported ten candidates of supernovae within the same day as the observation. From these runs, we learned the follow-ing lessons: (1) the training using artificial objects is effective in filtering out false candidates, especially for faint objects, and (2) combination of ML by majority voting is advantageous.},

We measured spectroscopic host galaxy redshifts for 3,147 of these likely SNe and estimate that ∼1,000 are Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) with light-curve quality sufficient for a cosmological analysis. We use these data with simulations to determine the impact of core-collapse SN (CC SN) contamination on measurements of the dark energy equation of state parameter, w. Using the method of Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS), distances to SNe Ia and the contaminating CC SN distribution are simultaneously determined. We test light-curve based SN classification priors for BEAMS as well as a new classifi-cation method that relies upon host galaxy spectra and the association of SN type with host type. By testing several SN classification methods and CC SN parameterizations on large SN simulations, we estimate that CC SN contamination gives a systematic error on w ($\sigma$ CC},

abstract = {In the era of large astronomical surveys, photometric classification of supernovae (SNe) has become an important research field due to limited spectroscopic resources for candidate follow-up and classification. In this work, we present a method to photometrically classify type Ia supernovae based on machine learning with redshifts that are derived from the SN light-curves. This method is implemented on real data from the SNLS deferred pipeline, a purely photometric pipeline that identifies SNe Ia at high-redshifts (0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.1). Our method consists of two stages: feature extraction (obtaining the SN redshift from photometry and estimating light-curve shape parameters) and machine learning classifica-tion. We study the performance of different algorithms such as Random Forest and Boosted Decision Trees. We evaluate the performance using SN simulations and real data from the first 3 years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), which contains large spectroscopically and photometrically classified type Ia samples. Using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, where perfect classification is given by 1, we find that our best-performing classifier (Extreme Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) has an AUC of 0.98. We show that it is possible to obtain a large photometrically selected type Ia SN sample with an estimated contamination of less than 5{\%}. When applied to data from the first three years of SNLS, we obtain 529 events. We investigate the differences between classifying simulated SNe, and real SN survey data. In particular, we find that applying a thorough set of selection cuts to the SN sample is essential for good classification. This work demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of machine learning classification in a high-z SN survey with application to real SN data.},

abstract = {Automated photometric supernova classification has become an active area of research in recent years in light of current and upcoming imaging surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, given that spectroscopic confirmation of type for all supernovae discovered will be impossible. Here, we develop a multi-faceted classification pipeline, combining existing and new approaches. Our pipeline consists of two stages: extracting descriptive features from the light curves and classification using a machine learning algorithm. Our feature extraction methods vary from model-dependent techniques, namely SALT2 fits, to more independent techniques that fit parametric models to curves, to a completely model-independent wavelet approach. We cover a range of representative machine learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and boosted decision trees (BDTs). We test the pipeline on simulated multi-band DES light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge. Using the commonly used area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic as a metric, we find that the SALT2 fits and the wavelet approach, with the BDTs algorithm, each achieve an AUC of 0.98, where 1 represents perfect classification. We find that a representative training set is essential for good classification, whatever the feature set or algorithm, with implications for spectroscopic follow-up. Importantly, we find that by using either the SALT2 or the wavelet feature sets with a BDT algorithm, accurate classification is possible purely from light curve data, without the need for any redshift information.},

This diagram was constructed using photometry from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey and absorption line spectroscopy from the Keck observatory. The method used to measure distances to these supernovae is based on recent work by Hamuy {\&} Pinto (2002) and exploits a correlation between the absolute brightness of SNe II-P and the expansion velocities derived from the minimum of the Fe II 516.9 nm P-Cygni feature observed during the plateau phases. We present three refinements to this method which significantly improve the practicality of measuring the distances of SNe II-P at cosmologically interesting redshifts. These are an extinction correction measurement based on the V-I colors at day 50, a cross-correlation measurement for the expansion velocity and the ability to extrapolate such velocities accurately over almost the entire plateau phase. We apply this revised method to our dataset of high-redshift SNe II-P and find that the resulting Hubble diagram has a scatter of only 0.26 magnitudes, thus demonstrating the feasibility of measuring the expansion history, with present facilities, using a method independent of that based upon supernovae of Type Ia.},

abstract = {Bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence to stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models the necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly efficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in the way MultiNest explores the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected by MultiNest, including those previously discarded under the constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We apply this technique to several challenging test problems and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with INS against those from vanilla NS.},

The evidence (alternatively the marginal likelihood, marginal density of the data, or the prior predictive) is immediately obtained by summation. It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the “nested” contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values.

On the one hand, the model may be expanded as a Taylor series and corrections to the several parameters calculated at each iteration on the assumption of local lincarity. On the other hand, various modifications of the method of steepest-descent have been used. Both methods not infrequently run aground, the Taylor series method because of divergence of the successive iterates, the steepest-descent (or gradient) methods because of agonizingly slow convergence after the first few iterations. In this paper a maximum neighborhood method is developed which, in effect, performs an optimum interpolation between the Taylor series method and the gradient method, the interpolation being based upon the maximum neighborhood in which the truncated Taylor series gives an adequate representation of the nonlinear model. The results are extended to the problem of solving a set of nonlinear algebraic equations.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {MPFIT is a port to IDL of the non-linear least squares fitting pro-gram MINPACK-1. MPFIT inherits the robustness of the original FORTRAN version of MINPACK-1, but is optimized for performance and convenience in IDL. In addition to the main fitting engine, MPFIT, several specialized functions are provided to fit 1-D curves and 2-D images; 1-D and 2-D peaks; and interac-tive fitting from the IDL command line. Several constraints can be applied to model parameters, including fixed constraints, simple bounding constraints, and " tying " the value to another parameter. Several data weighting methods are al-lowed, and the parameter covariance matrix is computed. Extensive diagnostic capabilities are available during the fit, via a call-back subroutine, and after the fit is complete. Several different forms of documentation are provided, including a tutorial, reference pages, and frequently asked questions. The package has been translated to C and Python as well. The full IDL and C packages can be found at http://purl.com/net/mpfit.},

abstract = {SN2017egm is the closest (z=0.03) H-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) detected to date, and a rare example of an SLSN-I in a massive and metal-rich galaxy. Here we present the HST UV {\&} optical spectra covering (1000 - 5500)A taken at +3 day relative to the peak. Our data reveal two sets of absorption systems, separated by 235 km/s, at redshifts matching the host galaxy, NGC3191 and its companion galaxy 73 arcsec apart. Weakly damped Lyman-alpha absorption lines are detected at these two redshifts, with HI column densities of {\$}(3.0\backslashpm0.8)\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}19{\}}{\$} and {\$}(3.7\backslashpm0.9)\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}19{\}}{\$}$\backslash$,cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} respectively. This is an order of magnitude smaller than HI column densities in the disks of nearby galaxies ({\$}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) and suggests that SN2017egm is on the near side of NGC3191 and has a low host extinction (E(B-V)=0.007). Using unsaturated metal absorption lines and taking into account of H ionization and dust depletion corrections, we find that the host of SN2017egm probably has a solar or higher metallicity and is unlikely to be a dwarf companion to NGC3191. Comparison of early-time UV spectra of SN2017egm, Gaia16apd, iPTF13ajg and PTF12dam finds that the continuum at wavelength {\textgreater} 2800A is well fit by a blackbody, whereas the continuum at wavelength {\textless} 2800A is considerably below the model. The degree of UV suppression varies from source to source, with the 1400A to 2800A continuum flux ratio of 1.5 for Gaia16apd and 0.4 for iPTF13ajg. This can not be explained by the differences in magnetar power or blackbody temperature (i.e. color temperature). Finally, the UV spectra reveal a common set of seven broad absorption features and their equivalent widths are similar (within a factor of 2) among the four events. These seven features bode well for future high-z SLSN-I spectral classifications.},

These events are characterized by fast light curve evolution (rise to peak in {\$}\backslashlesssim 10{\$} d and exponential decline in {\$}\backslashlesssim30{\$} d after peak). We discovered 72 events, including 37 transients with a spectroscopic redshift from host galaxy spectral features. The 37 events increase the total number of rapid optical transients by more than factor of two.

Spectra taken around peak are dominated by a blue featureless continuum consistent with hot, optically thick ejecta. We compare our events with a previously suggested physical scenario involving shock breakout in an optically thick wind surrounding a core-collapse supernova (CCSNe), we conclude that current models for such a scenario might need an additional power source to describe the exponential decline. We find these transients tend to favor star-forming host galaxies, which could be consistent with a core-collapse origin. However, more detailed modeling of the light curves is necessary to determine their physical origin.},

abstract = {—A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) dis-tribution. In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the n-dimensional setting, however, it requires the inversion of an n × n covariance matrix, C, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, det(C). In many cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of the form C = $\sigma$ 2 I + K, where K is computed using a specified covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters (hyperparameters). The matrix C is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require O(n 3) work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix C can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an O(n log 2 n) algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant det(C), permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining K. Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance kernels.},

abstract = {A method is presented for automated photometric classification of supernovae (SNe) as Type-Ia or non-Ia. A two-step approach is adopted in which: (i) the SN lightcurve flux measure-ments in each observing filter are fitted separately to an analytical parameterised function that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate vitrually all types of SNe; and (ii) the fitted function parameters and their associated uncertainties, along with the number of flux measurements, the maximum-likelihood value of the fit and Bayesian evidence for the model, are used as the input feature vector to a classification neural network (NN) that outputs the probability that the SN under consideration is of Type-Ia. The method is trained and tested using data released following the SuperNova Photometric Classification Challenge (SNPCC), consisting of lightcurves for 21,319 SNe in total. We consider several random divisions of the data into training and testing sets: for instance, for our sample D 1 (D 4), a total of 10 (40) per cent of the data are involved in training the algorithm and the remainder used for blind testing of the resulting classifier; we make no selection cuts. Assigning a canonical threshold probability of p th = 0.5 on the network output to class a SN as Type-Ia, for the sample D 1 (D 4) we ob-tain a completeness of 0.78 (0.82), purity of 0.77 (0.82), and SNPCC figure-of-merit of 0.41 (0.50). Including the SN host-galaxy redshift and its uncertainty as additional inputs to the classification network results in a modest 5–10 per cent increase in these values. We find that the quality of the classification does not vary significantly with SN redshift. Moreover, our probabilistic classification method allows one to calculate the expected completeness, purity and figure-of-merit (or other measures of classification quality) as a function of the thresh-old probability p th , without knowing the true classes of the SNe in the testing sample, as is the case in the classification of real SNe data. The method may thus be improved further by optimising p th and can easily be extended to divide non-Ia SNe into their different classes.},

abstract = {We show model light curves of superluminous supernova 2006gy on the assumption that the supernova is powered by the collision of supernova ejecta and its dense circumstellar medium. The initial conditions are constructed based on the shock breakout condition, assuming that the circumstellar medium is dense enough to cause the shock breakout within it. We perform a set of numerical light curve calculations by using a one-dimensional multigroup radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. We succeeded in reproducing the overall features of the early light curve of SN 2006gy with the circumstellar medium whose mass is about 15 Msun (the average mass-loss rate {\~{}} 0.1 Msun/yr). Thus, the progenitor of SN 2006gy is likely a very massive star. The density profile of the circumstellar medium is not well constrained by the light curve modeling only, but our modeling disfavors the circumstellar medium formed by steady mass loss. The ejecta mass is estimated to be comparable to or less than 15 Msun and the explosion energy is expected to be more than 4e51 erg. No 56Ni is required to explain the early light curve. We find that the multidimensional effect, e.g., the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which is expected to take place in the cool dense shell between the supernova ejecta and the dense circumstellar medium, is important in understanding supernovae powered by the shock interaction. We also show the evolution of the optical and near-infrared model light curves of high-redshift superluminous supernovae. They can be potentially used to identify SN 2006gy-like superluminous supernovae in the future optical and near-infrared transient surveys.},

The sample suitable for this kind of work now includes 11 SLSNe Ic, which have thus far been used solely in tests involving {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM. In this paper, we broaden the base of support for this new, important cosmic probe by using these observations to carry out a one-on-one comparison between the {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm h{\}}=ct{\$} and {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmologies. We individually optimize the parameters in each cosmological model by minimizing the {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} statistic. We also carry out Monte Carlo simulations based on these current SLSN Ic measurements to estimate how large the sample would have to be in order to rule out either model at a {\$}\backslashsim 99.7\backslash{\%}{\$} confidence level. The currently available sample indicates a likelihood of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}{\$}70-80\backslash{\%}{\$} that the {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm h{\}}=ct{\$} Universe is the correct cosmology versus {\$}\backslashsim{\$}{\$}20-30\backslash{\%}{\$} for the standard model. These results are suggestive, though not yet compelling, given the current limited number of SLSNe Ic. We find that if the real cosmology is {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM, a sample of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}{\$}240{\$} SLSNe Ic would be sufficient to rule out {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm h{\}}=ct{\$} at this level of confidence, while {\$}\backslashsim{\$}{\$}480{\$} SLSNe Ic would be required to rule out {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM if the real Universe is instead {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm h{\}}=ct{\$}. This difference in required sample size reflects the greater number of free parameters available to fit the data with {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM. If such SLSNe Ic are commonly detected in the future, they could be a powerful tool for constraining the dark-energy equation of state in {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM, and differentiating between this model and the {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm h{\}}=ct{\$} Universe.},

abstract = {Host galaxy properties provide strong constraints on the stellar progenitors of superluminous supernovae. By comparing a sample of 19 low-redshift (z {\textless} 0.3) superluminous supernova hosts to galaxy populations in the local Universe, we show that sub-solar metallicities seem to be a requirement. All superluminous supernovae in hosts with high measured gas-phase metallicities are found to explode at large galactocentric radii, indicating that the metallicity at the explosion site is likely lower than the integrated host value. We found that superluminous supernovae hosts do not always have star-formation rates higher than typical star-forming galaxies of the same mass. However, we confirm that high absolute specific star-formation rates are a feature of superluminous supernova host galaxies, but interpret this as simply a consequence of the anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and specific star-formation rate and the requirement of on-going star formation to produce young, massive stars greater than {\~{}} 10-20 M{\_}sol. Based on our sample, we propose an upper limit of {\~{}} 0.5 Z{\_}sol for forming superluminous supernova progenitors (assuming an N2 metallicity diagnostic and a solar oxygen abundance of 8.69). Finally, we show that if magnetar powering is the source of the extreme luminosity then the required initial spins appear to be correlated with metallicity of the host galaxy. This correlation needs further work, but if it holds it is a powerful link between the supernova parameters and nature of the progenitor population.},

abstract = {We present results from a study of the photometric redshift performance of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), using the early data from a Science Verification (SV) period of observations in late 2012 and early 2013 that provided science-quality images for almost 200 sq.{\~{}}deg.{\~{}}at the nominal depth of the survey. We assess the photometric redshift performance using about 15000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts available from other surveys. These galaxies are used, in different configurations, as a calibration sample, and photo-{\$}z{\$}'s are obtained and studied using most of the existing photo-{\$}z{\$} codes. A weighting method in a multi-dimensional color-magnitude space is applied to the spectroscopic sample in order to evaluate the photo-{\$}z{\$} performance with sets that mimic the full DES photometric sample, which is on average significantly deeper than the calibration sample due to the limited depth of spectroscopic surveys. Empirical photo-{\$}z{\$} methods using, for instance, Artificial Neural Networks or Random Forests, yield the best performance in the tests, achieving core photo-{\$}z{\$} resolutions {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}68{\}} \backslashsim 0.08{\$}. Moreover, the results from most of the codes, including template fitting methods, comfortably meet the DES requirements on photo-{\$}z{\$} performance, therefore, providing an excellent precedent for future DES data sets.},

abstract = {In Part I we introduce the method and results of the Twin Supernova analysis. This novel approach to Type Ia supernova standardization is currently only possible with spectrophotometric timeseries observations from the Nearby Supernova Factory. As Chapters 1 through 4 will explore, we select an ideal subset of supernovae, find pairs whose features match well in flux at all wavelengths and times, and test their dispersion in brightness. The analysis is completed in a blinded fashion, ensuring that we are not tuning our results. What we find is that twin supernovae do indeed have a small brightness dispersion. Part II shows two additional analyses related to the standardization of Type Ia supernovae. In Chapter 5 we present a check on the results of Bailey et al. [2009]. Literature supernovae with spectra near maximum light were tested to see how well their magnitudes could be standardized using the flux ratio method of Bailey et al [2009]. Chapter 6 shows a study with data from the Nearby Supernova Factory. Using only the spectrophotometric observations near maximum light, we calculate monochromatic Hubble Diagram residuals for each supernova. Those residuals are then corrected using a flux ratio, similar to Bailey et al. [2009] to test the standardization possibilities using only near-maximum observations.},

abstract = {The near-maximum spectra of most superluminous supernovae that are not dominated by in-teraction with a H-rich CSM (SLSN-I) are characterised by a blue spectral peak and a series of absorption lines which have been identified as O II. SN 2011kl, associated with the ultra-long gamma-ray burst GRB111209A, also had a blue peak but a featureless optical/UV spectrum. Radiation transport methods are used to show that the spectra (not including SN 2007bi, which has a redder spectrum at peak, like ordinary SNe Ic) can be explained by a rather steep den-sity distribution of the ejecta, whose composition appears to be typical of carbon-oxygen cores of massive stars which can have low metal content. If the photospheric velocity is ∼ 10000 − 15000 km s −1 several lines form in the UV. O II lines, however, arise from very highly excited lower levels, which require significant departures from Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium to be populated. These SLSNe are not thought to be powered primarily by 56 Ni decay. An appealing scenario is that they are energised by X-rays from the shock driven by a magnetar wind into the SN ejecta. The apparent lack of evolution of line velocity with time that characterises SLSNe up to about maximum is another argument in favour of the magnetar scenario. The smooth UV continuum of SN 2011kl requires higher ejecta velocities (∼ 20000 km s −1): line blanketing leads to an almost featureless spectrum. Helium is ob-served in some SLSNe after maximum. The high ionization near maximum implies that both He and H may be present but not observed at early times. The spectroscopic classification of SLSNe should probably reflect that of SNe Ib/c. Extensive time coverage is required for an accurate classification.},

abstract = {We present the transient source detection efficiencies of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), parameterizing the number of transients that PTF found, versus the number of similar transients that occurred over the same period in the survey search area but that were missed. PTF was an optical sky survey carried out with the Palomar 48-inch telescope over 2009-2012, observing more than 8000 square degrees of sky with cadences of between 1 and 5 days, locating around 50,000 non-moving transient sources, and spectroscopically confirming around 1900 supernovae. We assess the effectiveness with which PTF detected transient sources, by inserting {\~{}}7 million artificial point sources into real PTF data. We then study the efficiency with which the PTF real-time pipeline recovered these sources as a function of the source magnitude, host galaxy surface brightness, and various observing conditions (using proxies for seeing, sky brightness, and transparency). The product of this study is a multi-dimensional recovery efficiency grid appropriate for the range of observing conditions that PTF experienced, and that can then be used for studies of the rates, environments, and luminosity functions of different transient types using detailed Monte Carlo simulations. We illustrate the technique using the observationally well-understood class of type Ia supernovae.},

abstract = {Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are very bright explosions that were only discovered recently and that show a preference for occurring in faint dwarf galaxies. Understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellar explosions in these environments is funda-mental in order to both uncover the elusive progenitors of SLSNe and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. In this paper, we present the first results of our project to study SUper-luminous Supernova Host galaxIES, focusing on the sample for which we have obtained spectroscopy. We show that SLSNe-I and SLSNe-R (hydrogen-poor) often (∼50 per cent in our sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs). The probability of this happening by chance is negligible and we therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the SLSN phenomenon are related. In contrast, SLSNe-II (hydrogen-rich) occur in more massive, more metal-rich galaxies with softer radi-ation fields. Therefore, if SLSNe-II constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likely different from those of H-poor SLSNe. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are, on average, not found in as extreme environments as H-poor SLSNe. We propose that H-poor SLSNe result from the very first stars exploding in a starburst, even earlier than GRBs. This might indicate a bottom-light initial mass function in these systems. SLSNe present a novel method of selecting candidate EELGs independent of their luminosity.},

abstract = {Most type-Ic core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) produce 56 Ni and neutron stars (NSs) or black holes (BHs). The dipole radiation of nascent NSs has usually been neglected in explaining supernovae (SNe) with peak absolute magnitude M peak in any band are −19.5 mag, while the 56 Ni can be neglected in fitting most type-Ic superluminous supernovae (SLSNe Ic) whose M peak in any band are −21 mag, since the luminosity from a magnetar (highly magnetized NS) can outshine that from a moderate amount of 56 Ni. For luminous SNe Ic with −21 M peak −19.5 mag, however, both contributions from 56 Ni and NSs cannot be neglected without serious modeling, since they are not SLSNe and the 56 Ni mass could be up to ∼ 0.5M ⊙ . In this paper we propose a unified model that contain contributions from both 56 Ni and a nascent NS. We select three luminous SNe Ic-BL, SN 2010ay, SN 2006nx, and SN 14475, and show that, if these SNe are powered by 56 Ni, the ratio of M Ni to M ej are unrealistic. Alternatively, we invoke the magnetar model and the hybrid (56 Ni + NS) model and find that they can fit the observations, indicating that our models are valid and necessary for luminous SNe Ic. Owing to the lack of late-time photometric data, we cannot break the parameter degeneracy and thus distinguish among the model parameters, but we can expect that future multi-epoch observations of luminous SNe can provide stringent constraints on 56 Ni yields and the parameters of putative magnetars. – 2 – Subject headings: stars: magnetars, -supernovae: general, -supernovae: individ-ual (SN 2010ay, SN 2006nx, SN 14475)},

abstract = {We show that energy deposited into an expanding supernova remnant by a highly magnetic (B {\~{}} 5 × 1014 G) neutron star spinning at an initial period of Pi ≈ 2-20 ms can substantially brighten the light curve. For magnetars with parameters in this range, the rotational energy is released on a timescale of days to weeks, which is comparable to the effective diffusion time through the supernova remnant. The late time energy injection can then be radiated without suffering overwhelming adiabatic expansion losses. The magnetar input also produces a central bubble that sweeps ejecta into an internal dense shell, resulting in a prolonged period of nearly constant photospheric velocity in the observed spectra. We derive analytic expressions for the light curve rise time and peak luminosity as a function of B and Pi , and the properties of the supernova ejecta that allow for direct inferences about the underlying magnetar in bright supernovae. We perform numerical radiation hydrodynamic calculations of a few specific instances and compare the resulting light curves to observed events. Magnetar birth is likely to impact more than a few percent of all core-collapse supernovae, and may naturally explain some of the brightest events ever seen (e.g., SN 2005ap and SN 2008es) at L {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1044 ergs s-1.},

abstract = {We present DES13S2cmm, the first spectroscopically-confirmed superluminous supernova (SLSN) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We briefly discuss the data and search algorithm used to find this event in the first year of DES operations, and outline the spectroscopic data obtained from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope to confirm its redshift (z = 0.663 ± 0.001 based on the host-galaxy emission lines) and likely spectral type (type I). Using this redshift, we find M peak U = −21.05 +0.10 −0.09 for the peak, rest-frame U -band absolute magnitude, and find DES13S2cmm to be located in a faint, low metallicity (sub-solar), low stellar-mass host galaxy (log(M/M ⊙) = 9.3 ± 0.3); consistent with what is seen for other SLSNe-I. We compare the bolometric light curve of DES13S2cmm to fourteen similarly well-observed SLSNe-I in the literature and find it possesses one of the slowest declining tails (beyond +30 days rest frame past peak), and is the faintest at peak. Moreover, we find the bolometric light curves of all SLSNe-I studied herein possess a dispersion of only 0.2–0.3 magnitudes between +25 and +30 days after peak (rest frame) depending on redshift range studied; this could be important for 'standardising' such supernovae, as is done with the more common type Ia. We fit the bolometric light curve of DES13S2cmm with two competing models for SLSNe-I – the radioactive decay of 56 Ni, and a magnetar – and find that while the magnetar is formally a better fit, neither model provides a compelling match to the data. Although we are unable to conclusively differentiate between these two physical models for this particular SLSN-I, further DES observations of more SLSNe-I should break this degeneracy, especially if the light curves of SLSNe-I can be observed beyond 100 days in the rest frame of the supernova.},

abstract = {Multiple observational lines of evidence support a connection between hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Both events require a powerful central energy source, usually attributed to a millisecond magnetar or an accreting black hole. The GRB-SLSN link raises several theoretical questions: What distinguishes the engines responsible for these different phenomena? Can a single engine power both a GRB and a luminous SN in the same event? We propose a new unifying model for magnetar thermalization and jet formation: misalignment between the rotation ({\$}{\{}\backslashbf \backslashOmega{\}}{\$}) and magnetic dipole ({\$}{\{}\backslashbf \backslashmu{\}}{\$}) axes thermalizes a fraction of the spindown power by reconnection in the striped equatorial wind, providing a guaranteed source of "thermal" emission to power the supernova. The remaining un-thermalized power energizes a relativistic jet. In this picture, the GRB-SLSN dichotomy is directly linked to {\$}{\{}\backslashbf \backslashOmega \backslashcdot \backslashmu{\}}{\$}. We extend earlier work to show that even weak relativistic jets of luminosity {\$}\backslashsim10{\^{}}{\{}46{\}}{\$} erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} can escape the expanding SN ejecta hours after the explosion, implying that escaping relativistic jets may accompany many SLSNe. We calculate the observational signature of these jets. We show that they may produce transient UV cocoon emission lasting a few hours when the jet breaks out of the ejecta surface. A longer-lived optical/UV signal may originate from a mildly-relativistic wind driven from the interface between the jet and the ejecta walls. This provides a new explanation for the secondary early-time maximum observed in some SLSNe light curves, such as LSQ14bdq. This scenario also predicts a population of GRB from on-axis jets with extremely long durations, potentially similar to the population of "jetted tidal disruption events", in coincidence with a small subset of SLSNe.},

abstract = {Supernovae (SNe) are stellar explosions driven by gravitational or thermonuclear energy, observed as electromagnetic radiation emitted over weeks or more. In all known SNe, this radiation comes from internal energy deposited in the outflowing ejecta by either radioactive decay of freshly-synthesized elements (typically 56Ni), stored heat deposited by the explosion shock in the envelope of a supergiant star, or interaction between the SN debris and slowly-moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. Here we report on a new class of luminous SNe whose observed properties cannot be explained by any of these known processes. These include four new SNe we have discovered, and two previously unexplained events (SN 2005ap; SCP 06F6) that we can now identify as members. These SNe are all {\~{}}10 times brighter than SNe Ia, do not show any trace of hydrogen, emit significant ultra-violet (UV) flux for extended periods of time, and have late-time decay rates which are inconsistent with radioactivity. Our data require that the observed radiation is emitted by hydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius ({\~{}}10{\^{}}15 cm) and expanding at high velocities ({\textgreater}10{\^{}}4 km s{\^{}}-1). These long-lived, UV-luminous events can be observed out to redshifts z{\textgreater}4 and offer an excellent opportunity to study star formation in, and the interstellar medium of, primitive distant galaxies.},

abstract = {The SUperluminous Supernova Host galaxIES (SUSHIES) survey aims to provide strong new constraints on the progenitors of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) by understanding the relationship to their host galaxies. Here, we present the photometric properties of 53 H-poor and 16 H-rich SLSN host galaxies out to {\$}z\backslashsim4{\$}. We model the spectral energy distributions of the hosts to derive physical properties (e.g., stellar mass and star-formation-rate distribution functions), which we compare with other established galaxy populations. At low redshift, H-poor SLSNe are preferentially found in very blue, low-mass galaxies with high average specific star-formation rates. As the redshift increases, the host population follows the general evolution of star-forming galaxies towards more luminous galaxies with higher absolute star-formation rates. After accounting for secular evolution, we find evidence for differential evolution in galaxy mass, but not in the {\$}B{\$}-band and the far UV luminosity ({\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} confidence). Most remarkable is the scarcity of hosts with stellar masses above {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} for both classes of SLSNe at all redshifts. In the case of H-poor SLSNe, we attribute this to a metallicity cut-off at {\$}\backslashsim0.4{\$} solar metallicity, above which the production efficiency is stifled. However, we argue that, in addition to a low metallicity, a short-lived stellar population is also required as a regulating factor for the SLSN production. Although the host population of H-rich SLSNe is very diverse, and therefore they show a weaker dependence on environmental properties, the lack of massive hosts suggests a stifled production efficiency above {\$}\backslashsim0.8{\$} solar metallicity. The large dispersion of the SLSN-IIn host properties is in stark contrast to those of GRB, ordinary core-collapse SN, and SLSN-I host galaxies. We propose that multiple progenitor channels give rise to SLSNe-IIn.},

abstract = {A rare class of 'superluminous' supernovae that are about ten or more times more luminous at their peaks than other types of luminous supernova has recently been found at low to intermediate redshifts. A small subset of these events have luminosities that evolve slowly and result in radiated energies of up to about 10(51) ergs. Therefore, they are probably examples of 'pair-instability' or 'pulsational pair-instability' supernovae with estimated progenitor masses of 100 to 250 times that of the Sun. These events are exceedingly rare at low redshift, but are expected to be more common at high redshift because the mass distribution of the earliest stars was probably skewed to high values. Here we report the detection of two superluminous supernovae, at redshifts of 2.05 and 3.90, that have slowly evolving light curves. We estimate the rate of events at redshifts of 2 and 4 to be approximately ten times higher than the rate at low redshift. The extreme luminosities of superluminous supernovae extend the redshift limit for supernova detection using present technology, previously 2.36 (ref. 8), and provide a way of investigating the deaths of the first generation of stars to form after the Big Bang.},

These SNe, PS1-10ky and PS1-10awh, are amongst the most luminous SNe ever discovered, comparable to the unusual transients SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6. Like SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6, they show characteristic high luminosities (M{\_}bol {\~{}} -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a few broad absorption lines, and no evidence for H or He. We have constructed a full multi-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energy distribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time-series spectroscopy for these SNe. Given the similarities between the SNe, we combine their light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course of explosion of (0.9-1.4) x 10{\^{}}51 erg. We find photospheric velocities of 12,000-19,000 km/s with no evidence for deceleration measured across {\~{}}3 rest-frame weeks around light-curve peak, consistent with the expansion of an optically-thick massive shell of material. We show that, consistent with findings for other ultra-luminous SNe in this class, radioactive decay is not sufficient to power PS1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for these events: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse SN, or SN shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star.},

abstract = {We have entered an era of massive data sets in astronomy. In particular, the number of supernova (SN) discoveries and classifications has substantially increased over the years from few tens to thousands per year. It is no longer the case that observations of a few prototypical events encapsulate most spectroscopic information about SNe, motivating the development of modern tools to collect, archive, organize, and distribute spectra in gen-eral and SN spectra in particular. For this reason, we have developed the Weizmann Interactive Supernova Data Repository (WISeREP)—an SQL-based database (DB) with an interactive Web-based graphical interface. The sys-tem serves as an archive of high-quality SN spectra, including both historical (legacy) data and data that are accu-mulated by ongoing modern programs. The archive provides information about objects, their spectra, and related metadata. Utilizing interactive plots, we provide a graphical interface to visualize data, perform line identification of the major relevant species, determine object redshifts, classify SNe, and measure expansion velocities. Guest users may view and download spectra or other data that have been placed in the public domain. Registered users may also view and download data that are proprietary to specific programs with which they are associated. The DB currently holds more than 8000 spectra, of which more than 5000 are public; the latter include published spectra from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), all of the SUSPECT (Supernova Spectrum) archive, the Caltech-Core-Collapse Program (CCCP), the CfA SN spectra archive, and published spectra from the University of California, Berkeley, SNDB repository. It offers an efficient and convenient way to archive data and share it with colleagues, and we expect that data stored in this way will be easy to access, increasing its visibility, usefulness, and scientific impact. We encourage the SN community worldwide to make use of the data and tools provided by WISeREP and to contribute data to be made globally available and archived for posterity.},

We report the discovery of three supernovae at spectroscopically-confirmed redshifts of 2.399 (HSC16adga), 1.965 (HSC17auzg), and 1.851 (HSC17dbpf), and two supernova candidates with host-galaxy photometric redshifts of 3.2 (HSC16apuo) and 4.2 (HSC17dsid), respectively. In this paper, we present their photometric properties and the spectroscopic properties of the confirmed high-redshift supernovae are presented in the accompanying paper Curtin et al. (2018). The supernovae with the confirmed redshifts of z {\~{}} 2 have rest ultraviolet peak magnitudes of around -21 mag, which make them superluminous supernovae. The discovery of three supernovae at z {\~{}} 2 roughly corresponds to an event rate of {\~{}} 900 Gpc-3 yr-1, which is already consistent with the total superluminous supernova rate estimated by extrapolating the local rate based on the cosmic star-formation history. Adding unconfirmed superluminous supernova candidates would increase the event rate. Our superluminous supernova candidates at the redshifts of around 3 and 4 indicate minimum superluminous supernova rates of {\~{}} 400 Gpc-3 yr-1 (z {\~{}} 3) and {\~{}} 500 Gpc-3 yr-1 (z {\~{}} 4). Because we have only performed a pilot search for high-redshift supernovae so far and have not completed selecting all the high-redshift supernova candidates, these rates are lower limits. Our initial results demonstrate the amazing capability of Hyper Suprime-Cam to discover high-redshift supernovae.},

The host galaxies have multi-band photometric redshifts consistent with the spectroscopic values. The supernovae were detected during their rise, allowing the spectra to be taken near maximum light. The restframe far-ultraviolet (FUV; ∼1000–2500{\AA}) spectra are made up in flux of approximately equal parts supernova and host galaxy. Weather conditions during observations were not ideal, and while the signal-to-noise ratios of the spectra are sufficient for redshift confirmation, the type of each event remains ambiguous. We compare our spectra to the few low redshift SLSN FUV spectra available to date and offer an interpretation as to the type of each supernova. We prefer SLSN-II classifications for all three events. The success of the first SHIZUCA Keck spectroscopic follow-up program is encouraging. It demonstrates that campaigns such as SHIZUCA are capable of identifying high redshift SLSNe with sufficient accuracy, speed and depth for rapid, well-cadenced and informative follow-up.},

We assemble a homogeneous sample of previously classified SLSNe I from the literature, and fit their light curves using Gaussian processes. From the fits, we identify four photometric parameters that have a high statistical significance when correlated, and combine them in a parameter space that conveys information on their luminosity and color evolution. This parameter space presents a new definition for SLSNe I, which can be used to analyse existing and future transient datasets. We find that 90{\%} of previously classified SLSNe I meet our new definition. We also examine the evidence for two subclasses of SLSNe I, combining their photometric evolution with spectroscopic information, namely the photospheric velocity and its gradient. A cluster analysis reveals the presence of two distinct groups. `Fast' SLSNe show fast light curves and color evolution, large velocities, and a large velocity gradient. `Slow' SLSNe show slow light curve and color evolution, small expansion velocities, and an almost non-existent velocity gradient. Finally, we discuss the impact of our analyses in the understanding of the powering engine of SLSNe, and their implementation as cosmological probes in current and future surveys.},

Despite the fact that the peak luminosity of PS15br is fainter than that of the other two objects, the spectrophotometric evolution is similar to SN2103hx and different from any other supernova in a similar luminosity space. We group all of them as SLSNe II and hence they are distinct from the known class of SLSN IIn. Both transients show a strong, multicomponent Ha emission after 200 d past maximum, which we interpret as an indication of the interaction of the ejecta with an asymmetric, clumpy circumstellar material. The spectra and photometric evolution of the two objects are similar to Type II supernovae, although they have much higher luminosity and evolve on slower time-scales. This is qualitatively similar to how SLSNe I compare with normal type Ic, in that the former are brighter and evolve more slowly. We apply a magnetar and an interaction semi-analytical code to fit the light curves of our two objects and SN2008es. The overall observational data set would tend to favour the magnetar, or central engine, model as the source of the peak luminosity, although the clear signature of late-time interaction indicates that interaction can play a role in the luminosity evolution of SLSNe II at some phases.},

abstract = {We investigate the use of type Ic superluminous supernovae (SLSN Ic) as standardizable candles and distance indicators. Their appeal as cosmological probes stems from their remarkable peak luminosities, hot blackbody temperatures, and bright rest-frame ultraviolet emission.We present a sample of 16 published SLSN, from redshifts 0.1 to 1.2, and calculate accurate K corrections to determine uniform magnitudes in 2 synthetic rest-frame filter bandpasses with central wavelengths at 400 nm and 520 nm. At 400 nm, we find an encouragingly low scatter in their uncorrected, raw mean magnitudes withM(400) =−21.86±0.35 mag for the full sample of 16 objects.We investigate the correlation between their decline rates and peak magnitude and find that the brighter events appear to declinemore slowly. In amanner similar to the Phillips relation for type Ia SNe (SNe Ia), we define a ∆M20 decline relation. This correlates peak magnitude and decline over 20 days and can reduce the scatter in standardized peak magnitudes to±0.22 mag.We further showthatM(400) appears to have a strong color dependence. Redder objects are fainter and also become redder faster. Using this peak magnitudecolor evolution relation, a surprisingly low scatter of between ±0.08 mag and ±0.13 mag can be found in peak magnitudes, depending on sample selection. However, we caution that only 8 to 10 objects currently have enough data to test this peak magnitudecolor evolution relation. We conclude that SLSN Ic are promising distance indicators in the high-redshift universe in regimes beyond those possible with SNe Ia. Although the empirical relationships are encouraging, the unknown progenitor systems, how they may evolve with redshift, and the uncertain explosion physics are of some concern. The two major measurement uncertainties are the limited numbers of low-redshift, well-studied objects available to test these relationships and internal dust extinction in the host galaxies. Key},

abstract = {We present an analysis of supernova light curves simulated for the upcoming Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova search. The simulations employ a code suite that generates and fits realistic light curves in order to obtain distance modulus/redshift pairs that are passed to a cosmology fitter. We investigated several different survey strategies including field selection, supernova selection biases, and photometric redshift measurements. Using the results of this study, we chose a 30 square degree search area in the griz filter set. We forecast 1) that this survey will provide a homogeneous sample of up to 4000 Type Ia supernovae in the redshift range 0.05{\textless}z{\textless}1.2, and 2) that the increased red efficiency of the DES camera will significantly improve high-redshift color measurements. The redshift of each supernova with an identified host galaxy will be obtained from spectroscopic observations of the host. A supernova spectrum will be obtained for a subset of the sample, which will be utilized for control studies. In addition, we have investigated the use of combined photometric redshifts taking into account data from both the host and supernova. We have investigated and estimated the likely contamination from core-collapse supernovae based on photometric identification, and have found that a Type Ia supernova sample purity of up to 98{\%} is obtainable given specific assumptions. Furthermore, we present systematic uncertainties due to sample purity, photometric calibration, dust extinction priors, filter-centroid shifts, and inter-calibration. We conclude by estimating the uncertainty on the cosmological parameters that will be measured from the DES supernova data.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. We present observations of DES16C2nm, the first spectroscopically confirmed hydrogen-free superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) at redshift z ≊ 2. DES16C2nm was discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Supernova Program, with follow-up photometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope, Gemini, and the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope supplementing the DES data. Spectroscopic observations confirm DES16C2nm to be at z = 1.998, and spectroscopically similar to Gaia16apd (a SLSN-I at z = 0.102), with a peak absolute magnitude of U = -22.26 ± 0.06. The high redshift of DES16C2nm provides a unique opportunity to study the ultraviolet (UV) properties of SLSNe-I. Combining DES16C2nm with 10 similar events from the literature, we show that there exists a homogeneous class of SLSNe-I in the UV ($\lambda$ rest ≊ 2500 {\AA}), with peak luminosities in the (rest-frame) U band, and increasing absorption to shorter wavelengths. There is no evidence that the mean photometric and spectroscopic properties of SLSNe-I differ between low (z {\textless} 1) and high redshift (z {\textgreater} 1), but there is clear evidence of diversity in the spectrum at $\lambda$ rest {\textless} 2000 {\AA}, possibly caused by the variations in temperature between events. No significant correlations are observed between spectral line velocities and photometric luminosity. Using these data, we estimate that SLSNe-I can be discovered to z = 3.8 by DES. While SLSNe-I are typically identified from their blue observed colors at low redshift (z {\textless} 1), we highlight that at z {\textgreater} 2 these events appear optically red, peaking in the observer-frame z-band. Such characteristics are critical to identify these objects with future facilities such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Euclid, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Telescope, which should detect such SLSNe-I to z = 3.5, 3.7, and 6.6, respectively.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the early, rising light curves of 18 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory and the La Silla-QUEST variability survey. We fit these early data flux using a simple power law (f(t) = $\alpha$ × tn) to determine the time of first light (t0), and hence the rise time (trise) from first light to peak luminosity, and the exponent of the power-law rise (n). We find a mean uncorrected rise time of 18.98 ± 0.54 d, with individual supernova (SN) rise times ranging from 15.98 to 24.7 d. The exponent n shows significant departures from the simple `fireball model' of n = 2 (or f(t) ∝ t2) usually assumed in the literature. With a mean value of n = 2.44 ± 0.13, our data also show significant diversity from event to event. This deviation has implications for the distribution of 56Ni throughout the SN ejecta, with a higher index suggesting a lesser degree of 56Ni mixing. The range of n found also confirms that the 56Ni distribution is not standard throughout the population of SNe Ia, in agreement with earlier work measuring such abundances through spectral modelling. We also show that the duration of the very early light curve, before the luminosity has reached half of its maximal value, does not correlate with the light-curve shape or stretch used to standardize SNe Ia in cosmological applications. This has implications for the cosmological fitting of SN Ia light curves.},

abstract = {The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is a five-year optical imaging campaign with the goal of understanding the origin of cosmic acceleration. DES performs a ∼ 5000 deg 2 survey of the southern sky in five optical bands (g, r, i, z,Y) to a depth of ∼24th magnitude. Contemporaneously, DES performs a deep, time-domain survey in four optical bands (g, r, i, z) over ∼ 27 deg 2 . DES exposures are processed nightly with an evolving data reduction pipeline and evaluated for image quality to determine if they need to be retaken. Difference imaging and transient source detection are also performed in the time domain component nightly. On a bi-annual basis, DES exposures are reprocessed with a refined pipeline and coadded to maximize imaging depth. Here we describe the DES image processing pipeline in support of DES science, as a reference for users of archival DES data, and as a guide for future astronomical surveys.},

We consider a sample of over 1.3 million galaxies distributed over a footprint of 1318 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} with {\$}0.6 {\textless} z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm photo{\}} {\textless} 1{\$} and a typical redshift uncertainty of {\$}0.03(1+z){\$}. This sample was selected, as fully described in a companion paper, using a color/magnitude selection that optimizes trade-offs between number density and redshift uncertainty. We investigate the BAO signal in the projected clustering using three conventions, the angular separation, the co-moving transverse separation, and spherical harmonics. Further, we compare results obtained from template based and machine learning photometric redshift determinations. We use 1800 simulations that approximate our sample in order to produce covariance matrices and allow us to validate our distance scale measurement methodology. We measure the angular diameter distance, {\$}D{\_}A{\$}, at the effective redshift of our sample divided by the true physical scale of the BAO feature, {\$}r{\_}{\{}\backslashrm d{\}}{\$}. We obtain close to a 4 per cent distance measurement of {\$}D{\_}A(z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}=0.81)/r{\_}{\{}\backslashrm d{\}} = 10.75\backslashpm 0.43 {\$}. These results are consistent with the flat {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM concordance cosmological model supported by numerous other recent experimental results.},

abstract = {We characterize the variation in photometric response of the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) across its 520{\~{}}Mpix science array during 4 years of operation. These variations are measured using high signal-to-noise aperture photometry of {\$}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}7{\$} stellar images in thousands of exposures of a few selected fields, with the telescope dithered to move the sources around the array. A calibration procedure based on these results brings the RMS variation in aperture magnitudes of bright stars on cloudless nights down to 2--3 mmag, with {\textless}1 mmag of correlated photometric errors for stars separated by {\$}\backslashge20{\$}". On cloudless nights, any departures of the exposure zeropoints from a secant airmass law exceeding {\textgreater}1 mmag are plausibly attributable to spatial/temporal variations in aperture corrections. These variations can be inferred and corrected by measuring the fraction of stellar light in an annulus between 6" and 8" diameter. Key elements of this calibration include: correction of amplifier nonlinearities; distinguishing pixel-area variations and stray light from quantum-efficiency variations in the flat fields; field-dependent color corrections; and the use of an aperture-correction proxy. The DECam response pattern across the 2-degree field drifts over months by up to {\$}\backslashpm7{\$} mmag, in a nearly-wavelength-independent low-order pattern. We find no fundamental barriers to pushing global photometric calibrations toward mmag accuracy.},

abstract = {Photometric redshifts are estimated on the basis of template scenarios with the help of the code ZPEG, an extension of the galaxy evolution model PEGASE.2 and available on the PEGASE web site. The spectral energy distribution (SED) templates are computed for nine spectral types including starburst, irregular, spiral and elliptical. Dust, extinction and metal effects are coherently taken into account, depending on evolution scenarios. The sensitivity of results to adding near-infrared colors and IGM absorption is analyzed. A comparison with results of other models without evolution measures the evolution factor which systematically increases the estimated photometric redshift values by {\$}\backslashDelta z{\$} {\textgreater} 0.2 for z {\textgreater} 1.5. Moreover we systematically check that the evolution scenarios match observational standard templates of nearby galaxies, implying an age constraint of the stellar population at z=0 for each type. The respect of this constraint makes it possible to significantly improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts by decreasing the well-known degeneracy problem. The method is applied to the HDF-N sample. From fits on SED templates by a {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$}-minimization procedure, not only is the photometric redshift derived but also the corresponding spectral type and the formation redshift {\$}z{\_}for{\$} when stars first formed. Early epochs of galaxy formation z {\textgreater} 5 are found from this new method and results are compared to faint galaxy count interpretations.

abstract = {With an increasing number of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) discovered the question of their origin remains open and causes heated debates in the supernova community. Currently, there are three proposed mechanisms for SLSNe: (1) pair-instability supernovae (PISN), (2) magnetar-driven supernovae, and (3) models in which the supernova ejecta interacts with a circumstellar material ejected before the explosion. Based on current observations of SLSNe, the PISN origin has been disfavoured for a number of reasons. Many PISN models provide overly broad light curves and too reddened spectra, because of massive ejecta and a high amount of nickel. In the current study we re-examine PISN properties using progenitor models computed with the GENEC code. We calculate supernova explosions with FLASH and light curve evolution with the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. We find that high-mass models (200 and 250 solar masses) at relatively high metallicity (Z=0.001) do not retain hydrogen in the outer layers and produce relatively fast evolving PISNe Type I and might be suitable to explain some SLSNe. We also investigate uncertainties in light curve modelling due to codes, opacities, the nickel-bubble effect and progenitor structure and composition.},

abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 UV and near-IR (nIR) imaging of 21 Superluminous Supernovae (SLSNe) host galaxies, providing a sensitive probe of star formation and stellar mass with the hosts. Comparing the photometric and morphological properties of these host galaxies with those of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), we find SLSN hosts are fainter and more compact at both UV and nIR wavelengths, in some cases we barely recover hosts with absolute magnitude around MV {\~{}} -14. With the addition of ground based optical observations and archival results, we produce spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to these hosts, and show that SLSN hosts possess lower stellar mass and star formation rates. This is most pronounced for the hydrogen deficient Type-I SLSN hosts, although Type-II H-rich SLSN host galaxies remain distinct from the bulk of CCSNe, spanning a remarkably broad range of absolute magnitudes, with {\~{}}30{\%} of SLSNe-II arising from galaxies fainter than Mn I R {\~{}} -14. The detection of our faintest SLSN hosts increases the confidence that SLSNe-I hosts are distinct from those of LGRBs in star formation rate and stellar mass, and suggests that apparent similarities in metallicity may be due to the limited fraction of hosts for which emission line metallicity measurements are feasible. The broad range of luminosities of SLSN-II hosts is difficult to describe by metallicity cuts, and does not match the expectations of any reasonable UV-weighted luminosity function, suggesting additional environmental constraints are likely necessary to yield hydrogen rich SLSNe.},

abstract = {We study SN 2006oz, a newly-recognized member of the class of H-poor, super-luminous supernovae. We present multi-color light curves from the SDSS-II SN Survey, that cover the rise time, as well as an optical spectrum that shows that the explosion occurred at z{\~{}}0.376. We fitted black body functions to estimate the temperature and radius evolution of the photosphere and used the parametrized code SYNOW to model the spectrum. We constructed a bolometric light curve and compared it with explosion models. The very early light curves show a dip in the g- and r-bands and a possible initial cooling phase in the u-band before rising to maximum light. The bolometric light curve shows a precursor plateau with a duration of 6-10 days in the rest-frame. A lower limit of M{\_}u {\textless} -21.5 can be placed on the absolute peak luminosity of the SN, while the rise time is constrained to be at least 29 days. During our observations, the emitting sphere doubled its radius to 2x10{\^{}}15 cm, while the temperature remained hot at 15000 K. As for other similar SNe, the spectrum is best modeled with elements including O II and Mg II, while we tentatively suggest that Fe III might be present. We suggest that the precursor plateau might be related to a recombination wave in a circumstellar medium (CSM) and discuss whether this is a common property of all similar explosions. The subsequent rise can be equally well described by input from a magnetar or by ejecta-CSM interaction, but the models are not well constrained owing to the lack of post-maximum observations, and CSM interaction has difficulties accounting for the precursor plateau self-consistently. Radioactive decay is less likely to be the mechanism that powers the luminosity. The host galaxy, detected in deep imaging with the 10 m GTC, is a moderately young and star-forming, but not a starburst, galaxy. It has an absolute magnitude of M{\_}g = -16.9.},

abstract = {In the last decade, astronomers have found a new type of supernova called `superluminous supernovae' (SLSNe) due to their high peak luminosity and long light-curves. These hydrogen-free explosions (SLSNe-I) can be seen to z{\~{}}4 and therefore, offer the possibility of probing the distant Universe. We aim to investigate the possibility of detecting SLSNe-I using ESA's Euclid satellite, scheduled for launch in 2020. In particular, we study the Euclid Deep Survey (EDS) which will provide a unique combination of area, depth and cadence over the mission. We estimated the redshift distribution of Euclid SLSNe-I using the latest information on their rates and spectral energy distribution, as well as known Euclid instrument and survey parameters, including the cadence and depth of the EDS. We also applied a standardization method to the peak magnitudes to create a simulated Hubble diagram to explore possible cosmological constraints. We show that Euclid should detect approximately 140 high-quality SLSNe-I to z {\~{}} 3.5 over the first five years of the mission (with an additional 70 if we lower our photometric classification criteria). This sample could revolutionize the study of SLSNe-I at z{\textgreater}1 and open up their use as probes of star-formation rates, galaxy populations, the interstellar and intergalactic medium. In addition, a sample of such SLSNe-I could improve constraints on a time-dependent dark energy equation-of-state, namely w(a), when combined with local SLSNe-I and the expected SN Ia sample from the Dark Energy Survey. We show that Euclid will observe hundreds of SLSNe-I for free. These luminous transients will be in the Euclid data-stream and we should prepare now to identify them as they offer a new probe of the high-redshift Universe for both astrophysics and cosmology.},

abstract = {The rare hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) have been predominantly found in low-metallicity, star-forming dwarf galaxies. Here we identify Gaia17biu/SN 2017egm as an SLSN-I occurring in a "normal" spiral galaxy (NGC 3191) in terms of stellar mass (several times 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun) and metallicity (roughly solar). At redshift z=0.031, Gaia17biu is also the lowest redshift SLSN-I to date, and the absence of a larger population of SLSNe-I in dwarf galaxies of similar redshift suggests that metallicity is likely less important to the production of SLSNe-I than previously believed. With the smallest distance and highest apparent brightness for a SLSN-I, we are able to study Gaia17biu in unprecedented detail. Its pre-peak NUV to optical color is similar to that of Gaia16apd and among the bluest observed for a SLSN-I, while its peak luminosity (M{\_}g = -21) is at the low end of the SLSN-I luminosity function. The pre-peak spectra resemble those of some fast-declining SLSNe-I while the post-peak spectra are similar to those of slow-declining SLSNe-I, suggesting that the post-peak decline rate is probably not a useful indicator for describing the spectral diversity of SLSNe-I. Thanks to the high SNRs of our spectra, we identify several new spectroscopic features that may help to probe the properties of these enigmatic explosions. We also detect polarization at the {\~{}}0.5{\%} level that is not strongly dependent on wavelength, suggesting a modest, global departure from spherical symmetry for the source. In addition, we put the tightest upper limit yet on the radio luminosity of an SLSN-I at {\textless}5.4x10{\^{}}26 erg/s/Hz (at 10 GHz), which is almost a factor of 40 better than previous upper limits and one of the few measured at an early stage in the evolution of an SLSN-I.

abstract = {The Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) was the highest ranked large space-based mission of the 2010 New Worlds, New Horizons decadal survey. It is now a NASA mission in formulation with a planned launch in the mid-2020's. A primary mission objective is to precisely constrain the nature of dark energy through multiple probes, including Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Here, we present the first realistic simulations of the WFIRST SN survey based on current hardware specifications and using open-source tools. We simulate SN light curves and spectra as viewed by the WFIRST wide-field channel (WFC) imager and integral field channel (IFC) spectrometer, respectively. We examine 11 survey strategies with different time allocations between the WFC and IFC, two of which are based upon the strategy described by the WFIRST Science Definition Team, which measures SN distances exclusively from IFC data. We propagate statistical and, crucially, systematic uncertainties to predict the dark energy task force figure of merit (DETF FoM) for each strategy. The increase in FoM values with SN search area is limited by the overhead times for each exposure. For IFC-focused strategies the largest individual systematic uncertainty is the wavelength-dependent calibration uncertainty, whereas for WFC-focused strategies, it is the intrinsic scatter uncertainty. We find that the best IFC-focused and WFC-exclusive strategies have comparable FoM values. Even without improvements to other cosmological probes, the WFIRST SN survey has the potential to increase the FoM by more than an order of magnitude from the current values. Although the survey strategies presented here have not been fully optimized, these initial investigations are an important step in the development of the final hardware design and implementation of the WFIRST mission.},

The Y1A1 GOLD data set is assembled from multiple epochs of DES imaging and consists of calibrated photometric zeropoints, object catalogs, and ancillary data products - e.g., maps of survey depth and observing conditions, star-galaxy classification, and photometric redshift estimates - that are necessary for accurate cosmological analyses.

Photometric calibration of Y1A1 GOLD was performed by combining nightly zeropoint solutions with stellar-locus regression, and the absolute calibration accuracy is better than 2{\%} over the survey area.

abstract = {We present results for the first three years of OzDES, a six-year program to obtain redshifts for objects in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova fields using the 2dF fibre positioner and AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. OzDES is a multi-object spectroscopic survey targeting multiple types of targets at multiple epochs over a multi-year baseline, and is one of the first multi-object spectroscopic surveys to dynamically include transients into the target list soon after their discovery. At the end of three years, OzDES has spectroscopically confirmed almost 100 supernovae, and has measured redshifts for 17,000 objects, including the redshifts of 2,566 supernova hosts. We examine how our ability to measure redshifts for targets of various types depends on signal-to-noise, magnitude, and exposure time, finding that our redshift success rate increases significantly at a signal-to-noise of 2 to 3 per 1 Angstrom bin . We also find that the change in signal - to - noise with exposure time closely matches the Poisson limit for stacked exposures as long as 10 hours . We use these results to predict the redshift yield of the full OzDES survey , as well as the potential yields of future surveys on other facilities such as 4MOST , PFS , and MSE . This work marks the first OzDES data release , comprising 14 , 693 redshifts . OzDES is on target to obtain over 30 , 000 redshifts over the six - year duration of the survey , including a yield of approximately 5 , 700 supernova host - galaxy redshifts .},

We combine three two-point functions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million source galaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation function of 650,000 luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the galaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and source galaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we use independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric redshift estimation and validation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias, the bulk of the analysis was carried out while blind to the true results; we describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed and passed during this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM and {\$}w{\$}CDM cosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM) or 7 (for {\$}w{\$}CDM) cosmological parameters including the neutrino mass density and including the 457 {\$}\backslashtimes{\$} 457 element analytic covariance matrix.

We use two different source samples, obtained from the Metacalibration (26 million galaxies) and Im3shape (18 million galaxies) shear estimation codes, which are split into four photometric redshift bins in the range {\$}0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.3{\$}. We perform extensive testing of potential systematic effects that can bias the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, including those from shear estimation, photometric redshifts, and observational properties. Covariances are obtained from jackknife subsamples of the data and validated with a suite of log-normal simulations. We use the shear-ratio geometric test to obtain independent constraints on the mean of the source redshift distributions, providing validation of those obtained from other photo-{\$}z{\$} studies with the same data. We find consistency between the galaxy bias estimates obtained from our galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements and from galaxy clustering, therefore showing the galaxy-matter cross-correlation coefficient {\$}r{\$} to be consistent with one, measured over the scales used for the cosmological analysis. The results in this work present one of the three two-point correlation functions, along with galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, used in the DES cosmological analysis of Y1 data, and hence the methodology and the systematics tests presented here provide a critical input for that study as well as for future cosmological analyses in DES and other photometric galaxy surveys.},

abstract = {This overview article describes the legacy prospect and discovery potential of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it with examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five filters (grizY). By its completion the survey is expected to have generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from `Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of observations), what DES can tell us about the solar system, the Milky Way, galaxy evolution, quasars, and other topics. In addition, we show that if the cosmological model is assumed to be Lambda+ Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) then important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights from DES early data include the discovery of 34 Trans Neptunian Objects, 17 dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z {\textgreater} 6 quasar (and more confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).},

abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation techniques that robustly account for systematic measurement uncertainties will be crucial for the next generation of cosmological surveys. We present a new analysis method, superABC, for obtaining cosmological constraints from Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) without any likelihood assumptions. The ABC method works by using a forward model simulation of the data where systematic uncertainties can be simulated and marginalized over. A key feature of the method presented here is the use of two distinct metrics, the `Tripp' and `Light Curve' metrics, which allow us to compare the simulated data to the observed data set. The Tripp metric takes as input the parameters of models fit to each light curve with the SALT-II method, whereas the Light Curve metric uses the measured fluxes directly without model fitting. We apply the superABC sampler to a simulated data set of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1000 SNe corresponding to the first season of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program. Varying {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m, w{\_}0, \backslashalpha{\$} and {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} and a magnitude offset parameter, with no systematics we obtain {\$}\backslashDelta(w{\_}0) = w{\_}0{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm true{\}} - w{\_}0{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm best \backslash, fit{\}} = -0.036\backslashpm0.109{\$} (a {\$}\backslashsim11{\$}{\%} 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} uncertainty) using the Tripp metric and {\$}\backslashDelta(w{\_}0) = -0.055\backslashpm0.068{\$} (a {\$}\backslashsim7{\$}{\%} 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} uncertainty) using the Light Curve metric. Including 1{\%} calibration uncertainties in four passbands, adding 4 more parameters, we obtain {\$}\backslashDelta(w{\_}0) = -0.062\backslashpm0.132{\$} (a {\$}\backslashsim14{\$}{\%} 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} uncertainty) using the Tripp metric. Overall we find a {\$}17{\$}{\%} increase in the uncertainty on {\$}w{\_}0{\$} with systematics compared to without. We contrast this with a MCMC approach where systematic effects are approximately included. We find that the MCMC method slightly underestimates the impact of calibration uncertainties for this simulated data set.},

abstract = {We characterize the ability of the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to perform relative astrometry across its 500{\~{}}Mpix, 3 deg{\^{}}2 science field of view, and across 4 years of operation. This is done using internal comparisons of {\~{}}4x10{\^{}}7 measurements of high-S/N stellar images obtained in repeat visits to fields of moderate stellar density, with the telescope dithered to move the sources around the array. An empirical astrometric model includes terms for: optical distortions; stray electric fields in the CCD detectors; chromatic terms in the instrumental and atmospheric optics; shifts in CCD relative positions of up to {\~{}}10 um when the DECam temperature cycles; and low-order distortions to each exposure from changes in atmospheric refraction and telescope alignment. Errors in this astrometric model are dominated by stochastic variations with typical amplitudes of 10-30 mas (in a 30 s exposure) and 5-10 arcmin coherence length, plausibly attributed to Kolmogorov-spectrum atmospheric turbulence. The size of these atmospheric distortions is not closely related to the seeing. Given an astrometric reference catalog at density {\~{}}0.7 arcmin{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}, e.g. from Gaia, the typical atmospheric distortions can be interpolated to 7 mas RMS accuracy (for 30 s exposures) with 1 arcmin coherence length for residual errors. Remaining detectable error contributors are 2-4 mas RMS from unmodelled stray electric fields in the devices, and another 2-4 mas RMS from focal plane shifts between camera thermal cycles. Thus the astrometric solution for a single DECam exposure is accurate to 3-6 mas (0.02 pixels, or 300 nm) on the focal plane, plus the stochastic atmospheric distortion.},

abstract = {We describe the difference imaging pipeline (DiffImg) used to detect transients in deep images from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program (DES-SN) in its first observing season from Aug 2013 through Feb 2014. DES-SN is a search for transients in which ten 3-deg{\^{}}2 fields are repeatedly observed in the g,r,i,z passbands with a cadence of about 1 week. The observing strategy has been optimized to measure high-quality light curves and redshifts for thousands of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with the goal of measuring dark energy parameters. The essential DiffImg functions are to align each search image to a deep reference image, do a pixel-by-pixel subtraction, and then examine the subtracted image for significant positive detections of point-source objects. The vast majority of detections are subtraction artifacts, but after selection requirements and image filtering with an automated scanning program, there are 130 detections per deg{\^{}}2 per observation in each band, of which only 25{\%} are artifacts. Of the 7500 transients discovered by DES-SN in its first observing season, each requiring a detection on at least 2 separate nights, Monte Carlo simulations predict that 27{\%} are expected to be supernova. Another 30{\%} of the transients are artifacts, and most of the remaining transients are AGN and variable stars. Fake SNe Ia are overlaid onto the images to rigorously evaluate detection efficiencies, and to understand the DiffImg performance. The DiffImg efficiency measured with fake SNe agrees well with expectations from a Monte Carlo simulation that uses analytical calculations of the fluxes and their uncertainties. In our 8 "shallow" fields with single-epoch 50{\%} completeness depth 23.5, the SN Ia efficiency falls to 1/2 at redshift z 0.7, in our 2 "deep" fields with mag-depth 24.5, the efficiency falls to 1/2 at z 1.1.},

abstract = {The Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) is a five-year, 100-night, spectroscopic survey on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, whose primary aim is to measure redshifts of approximately 2500 Type Ia supernovae host galaxies over the redshift range 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2, and derive reverberation-mapped black hole masses for approximately 500 active galactic nuclei and quasars over 0.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 4.5. This treasure trove of data forms a major part of the spectroscopic follow-up for the Dark Energy Survey for which we are also targeting cluster galaxies, radio galaxies, strong lenses, and unidentified transients, as well as measuring luminous red galaxies and emission line galaxies to help calibrate photometric redshifts. Here, we present an overview of the OzDES programme and our first-year results. Between 2012 December and 2013 December, we observed over 10 000 objects and measured more than 6 000 redshifts. Our strategy of retargeting faint objects across many observing runs has allowed us to measure redshifts for galaxies as faint as mr = 25 mag. We outline our target selection and observing strategy, quantify the redshift success rate for different types of targets, and discuss the implications for our main science goals. Finally, we highlight a few interesting objects as examples of the fortuitous yet not totally unexpected discoveries that can come from such a large spectroscopic survey.},

abstract = {We present the first constraints on cosmology from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), using weak lensing measurements from the preliminary Science Verification (SV) data. We use 139 square degrees of SV data, which is less than 3$\backslash${\%} of the full DES survey area. Using cosmic shear 2-point measurements over three redshift bins we find {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8 (\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm m{\}}/0.3){\^{}}{\{}0.5{\}} = 0.81 \backslashpm 0.06{\$} (68$\backslash${\%} confidence), after marginalising over 7 systematics parameters and 3 other cosmological parameters. We examine the robustness of our results to the choice of data vector and systematics assumed, and find them to be stable. About {\$}20{\$}$\backslash${\%} of our error bar comes from marginalising over shear and photometric redshift calibration uncertainties. The current state-of-the-art cosmic shear measurements from CFHTLenS are mildly discrepant with the cosmological constraints from Planck CMB data; our results are consistent with both datasets. Our uncertainties are {\$}\backslashsim{\$}30$\backslash${\%} larger than those from CFHTLenS when we carry out a comparable analysis of the two datasets, which we attribute largely to the lower number density of our shear catalogue. We investigate constraints on dark energy and find that, with this small fraction of the full survey, the DES SV constraints make negligible impact on the Planck constraints. The moderate disagreement between the CFHTLenS and Planck values of {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8 (\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm m{\}}/0.3){\^{}}{\{}0.5{\}}{\$} is present regardless of the value of {\$}w{\$}.},

The camera was designed and constructed by the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration and meets or exceeds the stringent requirements designed for the wide-field and supernova surveys for which the collaboration uses it. The camera consists of a five-element optical corrector, seven filters, a shutter with a 60 cm aperture, and a charge-coupled device (CCD) focal plane of 250 $\mu$m thick fully depleted CCDs cooled inside a vacuum Dewar. The 570 megapixel focal plane comprises 62 2k × 4k CCDs for imaging and 12 2k × 2k CCDs for guiding and focus. The CCDs have 15 $\mu$m × 15 $\mu$m pixels with a plate scale of 0.″263 pixel-1. A hexapod system provides state-of-the-art focus and alignment capability. The camera is read out in 20 s with 6-9 electron readout noise. This paper provides a technical description of the camera's engineering, construction, installation, and current status.},

abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing allows one to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the projected mass density across the sky. These "mass maps" provide a powerful tool for studying cosmology as they probe both luminous and dark matter. In this paper, we present a weak lensing mass map reconstructed from shear measurements in a 139 deg{\^{}}2 area from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data overlapping with the South Pole Telescope survey. We compare the distribution of mass with that of the foreground distribution of galaxies and clusters. The overdensities in the reconstructed map correlate well with the distribution of optically detected clusters. Cross-correlating the mass map with the foreground galaxies from the same DES SV data gives results consistent with mock catalogs that include the primary sources of statistical uncertainties in the galaxy, lensing, and photo-z catalogs. The statistical significance of the cross-correlation is at the 6.8 sigma level with 20 arcminute smoothing. A major goal of this study is to investigate systematic effects arising from a variety of sources, including PSF and photo-z uncertainties. We make maps derived from twenty variables that may characterize systematics and find the principal components. We find that the contribution of systematics to the lensing mass maps is generally within measurement uncertainties. We test and validate our results with mock catalogs from N-body simulations. In this work, we analyze less than 3{\%} of the final area that will be mapped by the DES; the tools and analysis techniques developed in this paper can be applied to forthcoming larger datasets from the survey.},

abstract = {Spectral features introduced by instrumental chromaticity of radio interferometers have the potential to negatively impact the ability to perform Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD) science using the redshifted neutral hydrogen emission line from the early Universe. We describe instrument calibration choices that influence the spectral characteristics of the science data, and assess their impact on EoR statistical and tomographic experiments. Principally, we consider the intrinsic spectral response of the receiving antennas, embedded within a complete frequency-dependent primary beam response, and frequency-dependent instrument sampling. We assess different options for bandpass calibration. The analysis is applied to the proposed SKA1-Low EoR/CD experiments. We provide tolerances on the smoothness of the SKA station primary beam bandpass, to meet the scientific goals of statistical and tomographic (imaging) EoR programs. Two calibration strategies are tested: (1) fitting of each fine channel independently, and (2) fitting of an nth-order polynomial for each {\~{}}1{\~{}}MHz coarse channel with (n+1)th-order residuals (n=2,3,4). Strategy (1) leads to uncorrelated power in the 2D power spectrum proportional to the thermal noise power, thereby reducing the overall array sensitivity. Strategy (2) leads to correlated residuals from the fitting, and residual signal power with (n+1)th-order curvature. For the residual power to be less than the thermal noise, the fractional amplitude of a fourth-order term in the bandpass across a single coarse channel must be {\textless}2.5{\%} (50{\~{}}MHz), {\textless}0.5{\%} (150{\~{}}MHz), {\textless}0.8{\%} (200{\~{}}MHz). The tomographic experiment places stringent constraints on phase residuals in the bandpass. We find that the root-mean-square variability over all stations of the change in phase across any fine channel (4.578{\~{}}kHz) should not exceed 0.2 degrees.},

With exposure times ranging from 10 to 60 ksec per galaxy, we were able to obtain redshifts for 400 host galaxies in two SNLS fields, thereby substantially increasing the total number of SNLS supernovae with host galaxy redshifts. The median redshift of the galaxies in our sample that hosted photometrically classified Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is 0.77, which is 25{\%} higher than the median redshift of spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia in the three-year sample of the SNLS. Our results demonstrate that one can use wide-field fibre-fed multi-object spectrographs on 4m telescopes to efficiently obtain redshifts for large numbers of supernova host galaxies over the large areas of sky that will be covered by future high-redshift supernova surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey.},

abstract = {As a means of better understanding the evolution of optically selected galaxies we consider the distribution of galaxies within the multicolor space {\$}U{\$}, {\$}B{\_}J{\$}, {\$}R{\_}F{\$} and {\$}I{\_}N{\$}. We find that they form an almost planar distribution out to {\$}B{\_}J =22.5{\$} and {\$}z{\textless}0.3{\$}. The position of a galaxy within this plane is dependent on its redshift, luminosity and spectral type. While in the original {\$}U{\$}, {\$}B{\_}J{\$}, {\$}R{\_}F{\$} and {\$}I{\_}N{\$} space these properties are highly correlated we can define an optimal rotation of the photometric axes that makes much of this information orthogonal. Fitting the observed spectroscopic redshifts with a quadratic function of the four magnitudes we show that redshifts for galaxies can be estimated to an accuracy better than {\$}\backslashDelta z =0.05{\$}. This dispersion is due to the photometric uncertainties within the photographic data. Assuming no galaxy evolution we derive a set of simulated galaxy fluxes in the U, J, F and N passbands. Using these data we investigate how the redshift is encoded within the broadband magnitudes and the intrinsic dispersion of the photometric-redshift relation. We find that the signal that defines a galaxy's photometric redshift is not related to specific absorption or emission lines but comes from the break in the overall shape of the galaxy continuum at around 4000 $\backslash$AA. Using high signal-to-noise photometric data we estimate that it is possible to achieve an intrinsic dispersion of less than {\$}\backslashDelta z =0.02{\$}.},

abstract = {We calculate the volumetric rate of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) based on 5 events discovered with the ROTSE-IIIb telescope. We gather light curves of 19 events from the literature and our own unpublished data and employ crude k-corrections to constrain the pseudo-absolute magnitude distributions in the rest frame ROTSE-IIIb (unfiltered) band pass for both the hydrogen poor (SLSN-I) and hydrogen rich (SLSN-II) populations. We find that the peak magnitudes of the available SLSN-I are narrowly distributed ({\$}M = -21.7 \backslashpm 0.4{\$}) in our unfiltered band pass and may suggest an even tighter intrinsic distribution when the effects of dust are considered, although the sample may be skewed by selection and publication biases. The presence of OII features near maximum light may uniquely signal a high luminosity event, and we suggest further observational and theoretical work is warranted to assess the possible utility of such SN 2005ap-like SLSN-I as distance indicators. Using the pseudo-absolute magnitude distributions derived from the light curve sample, we measure the SLSN-I rate to be about (32{\^{}}{\{}+77{\}}{\_}{\{}-26{\}}) events Gpc{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} h{\_}{\{}71{\}}{\^{}}{\{}3{\}} at a weighted redshift of z = 0.17, and the SLSN-II rate to be about (151{\^{}}{\{}+151{\}}{\_}{\{}-82{\}}) events Gpc{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} h{\_}{\{}71{\}}{\^{}}{\{}3{\}} at z = 0.15. Given that the exact nature and limits of these populations are still unknown, we discuss how it may be difficult to distinguish these rare SLSNe from other transient phenomena such as AGN activity and tidal disruption events even when multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, or even high resolution imaging are available. Including one spectroscopically peculiar event, we determine a total rate for SLSN-like events of (199{\^{}}{\{}+137{\}}{\_}{\{}-86{\}}) events Gpc{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} h{\_}{\{}71{\}}{\^{}}{\{}3{\}} at z = 0.16.},

These events were detected and their multi-color light-curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshift. With this data set, we have built a Hubble diagram extending to z=1, with all distance measurements involving at least two bands. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated making use of the multi-band photometry obtained at CFHT. Cosmological fits to this first year SNLS Hubble diagram give the following results : Omega{\_}M = 0.263 +/- 0.042(stat) +/- 0.032(sys) for a flat LambdaCDM model; and w = -1.023 +/- 0.090(stat) +/- 0.054(sys) for a flat cosmology with constant equation of state w when combined with the constraint from the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the volumetric rate of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) at z{\~{}}1, measured using archival data from the first four years of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). We develop a method for the photometric classification of SLSNe to construct our sample. Our sample includes two previously spectroscopically-identified objects, and a further new candidate selected using our classification technique. We use the point-source recovery efficiencies from Perrett et.al. (2010) and a Monte Carlo approach to calculate the rate based on our SLSN sample. We find that the three identified SLSNe from SNLS give a rate of 91 (+76/-36) SNe/Yr/Gpc{\^{}}3 at a volume-weighted redshift of z=1.13. This is equivalent to 2.2 (+1.8/-0.9) x10{\^{}}-4 of the volumetric core collapse supernova rate at the same redshift. When combined with other rate measurements from the literature, we show that the rate of SLSNe increases with redshift in a manner consistent with that of the cosmic star formation history. We also estimate the rate of ultra-long gamma ray bursts (ULGRBs) based on the events discovered by the Swift satellite, and show that it is comparable to the rate of SLSNe, providing further evidence of a possible connection between these two classes of events. We also examine the host galaxies of the SLSNe discovered in SNLS, and find them to be consistent with the stellar-mass distribution of other published samples of SLSNe.},

A flat LambdaCDM cosmological fit to 231 SNLS high redshift Type Ia supernovae alone gives Omega{\_}M = 0.211 +/- 0.034(stat) +/- 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the photometric calibration.

abstract = {We present spectra and lightcurves of SNLS 06D4eu and SNLS 07D2bv, two hydrogen-free superluminous supernovae discovered by the Supernova Legacy Survey. At z = 1.588, SNLS 06D4eu is the highest redshift superluminous SN with a spectrum, at M{\_}U = -22.7 is one of the most luminous SNe ever observed, and gives a rare glimpse into the restframe ultraviolet where these supernovae put out their peak energy. SNLS 07D2bv does not have a host galaxy redshift, but based on the supernova spectrum, we estimate it to be at z {\~{}} 1.5. Both supernovae have similar observer-frame griz lightcurves, which map to restframe lightcurves in the U-band and UV, rising in {\~{}} 20 restframe days or longer, and declining over a similar timescale. The lightcurves peak in the shortest wavelengths first, consistent with an expanding blackbody starting near 15,000 K and steadily declining in temperature. We compare the spectra to theoretical models, and identify lines of C II, C III, Fe III, and Mg II in the spectrum of SNLS 06D4eu and SCP 06F6, and find that they are consistent with an expanding explosion of only a few solar masses of carbon, oxygen, and other trace metals. Thus the progenitors appear to be related to those suspected for SNe Ic. A high kinetic energy, 10{\^{}}52 ergs, is also favored. Normal mechanisms of powering core- collapse or thermonuclear supernovae do not seem to work for these supernovae. We consider models powered by 56Ni decay and interaction with circumstellar material, but find that the creation and spin-down of a magnetar with a period of 2ms, magnetic field of 2 x 10{\^{}}14 Gauss, and a 3 solar mass progenitor provides the best fit to the data.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the volumetric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate (SNR{\_}Ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). This analysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additional photometrically identified SNe Ia within the redshift range 0.1{\textless}z{\textless}1.1. The volumetric SNR{\_}Ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z{\~{}}1.0 that follows a power-law of the form (1+z){\^{}}alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. This evolutionary trend in the SNLS rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmic star-formation history over the same redshift range. We combine the SNLS rate measurements with those from other surveys that complement the SNLS redshift range, and fit various simple SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD) models to the combined data. A simple power-law model for the DTD (i.e., proportional to t{\^{}}-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending on the parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. A two-component model, where SNR{\_}Ia is dependent on stellar mass (Mstellar) and star formation rate (SFR) as SNR{\_}Ia(z)=AxMstellar(z) + BxSFR(z), yields the coefficients A=1.9+/-0.1 SNe/yr/M{\_}solar and B=3.3+/-0.2 SNe/yr/(M{\_}solar/yr). More general two-component models also fit the data well, but single Gaussian or exponential DTDs provide significantly poorer matches. Finally, we split the SNLS sample into two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that the general behavior in the rates of faster-declining SNe Ia (0.8{\textless}s{\textless}1.0) is similar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects (1.0{\textless}s{\textless}1.3) out to z{\~{}}0.8.},

abstract = {We present a method for selecting high-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) located via rolling SN searches. The technique, using both color and magnitude information of events from only two to three epochs of multiband real-time photometry, is able to discriminate between SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe. Furthermore, for SNe Ia the method accurately predicts the redshift, phase, and light-curve parameterization of these events based only on pre-maximum-light data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on a simulated survey of SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe, where the selection method effectively rejects most core-collapse SNe while retaining SNe Ia. We also apply the selection code to real-time data acquired as part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). During the period 2004 May to 2005 January in the SNLS, 440 SN candidates were discovered, of which 70 were confirmed spectroscopically as SNe Ia and 15 as core-collapse events. For this test data set, the selection technique correctly identifies 100{\%} of the identified SNe II as non-SNe Ia with only a 1{\%}–2{\%} false rejection rate. The predicted parameterization of the SNe Ia has a precision of {\'{A}} z j j/(1 þ z spec) {\textless} 0:09 in redshift and AE2–3 rest-frame days in phase, providing invaluable information for planning spectroscopic follow-up observations. We also in-vestigate any bias introduced by this selection method on the ability of surveys such as SNLS to measure cosmo-logical parameters (e.g., w and M) and find any effect to be negligible.},

abstract = {We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery of PS1-10afx, a unique hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (SLSN) at z=1.388. The light curve peaked at z{\_}P1=21.7 mag, making PS1-10afx comparable to the most luminous known SNe, with M{\_}u = -22.3 mag. Our extensive optical and NIR observations indicate that the bolometric light curve of PS1-10afx rose on the unusually fast timescale of {\~{}}12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (M{\_}bol = -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. Equally important, the SED is unusually red for a SLSN, with a color temperature of 6800 K near maximum light, in contrast to previous H-poor SLSNe, which are bright in the UV. The spectra more closely resemble those of a normal SN Ic than any known SLSN, with a photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in the rest-frame UV. Despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very large emitting radius (5e15 cm). We demonstrate that no existing theoretical model can satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-powered light curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fast timescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotating magnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) models invoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain the observed spectra or color evolution. The host galaxy is well detected in pre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near L*, a star formation rate of 15 M{\_}sun/yr, and is fairly massive (2e10 M{\_}sun), with a stellar population age of 1e8 yr, also in contrast to the dwarf hosts of known H-poor SLSNe. PS1-10afx is distinct from known examples of SLSNe in its spectra, colors, light-curve shape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a different channel than other hydrogen-poor SLSNe.},

abstract = {We present a technique to measure lightcurves of time-variable point sources on a spatially structured background from imaging data. The technique was developed to measure light curves of SNLS supernovae in order to infer their distances. This photometry technique performs simultaneous PSF photometry at the same sky position on an image series. We describe two implementations of the method: one that resamples images before measuring fluxes, and one which does not. In both instances, we sketch the key algorithms involved and present the validation using semi-artificial sources introduced in real images in order to assess the accuracy of the supernova flux measurements relative to that of surrounding stars. We describe the methods required to anchor these PSF fluxes to calibrated aperture catalogs, in order to derive SN magnitudes. We find a marginally significant bias of 2 mmag of the after-resampling method, and no bias at the mmag accuracy for the non-resampling method. Given surrounding star magnitudes, we determine the systematic uncertainty of SN magnitudes to be less than 1.5 mmag, which represents about one third of the current photometric calibration uncertainty affecting SN measurements. The SN photometry delivers several by-products: bright star PSF flux mea- surements which have a repeatability of about 0.6{\%}, as for aperture measurements; we measure relative astrometric positions with a noise floor of 2.4 mas for a single-image bright star measurement; we show that in all bands of the MegaCam instrument, stars exhibit a profile linearly broadening with flux by about 0.5{\%} over the whole brightness range.},

abstract = {We present a sample of 485 photometrically identified Type Ia supernova candidates mined from the first three years of data of the CFHT SuperNova Legacy Survey (SNLS). The images were submitted to a deferred processing independent of the SNLS real-time detection pipeline. Light curves of all transient events were reconstructed in the gM , rM , iM and zM filters and submitted to automated sequential cuts in order to identify possible supernovae. Pure noise and long-term variable events were rejected by light curve shape criteria. Type Ia supernova identification relied on event characteristics fitted to their light curves assuming the events to be normal SNe Ia. The light curve fitter SALT2 was used for this purpose, assigning host galaxy photometric redshifts to the tested events. The selected sample of 485 candidates is one magnitude deeper than that allowed by the SNLS spectroscopic identification. The contamination by supernovae of other types is estimated to be 4{\%}. Testing Hubble diagram residuals with this enlarged sample allows us to measure the Malmquist bias due to spectroscopic selections directly. The result is fully consistent with the precise Monte Carlo based estimate used to correct SN Ia distance moduli in the SNLS 3-year cosmological analyses. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a photometric selection of high redshift supernovae with known host galaxy redshifts, opening interesting prospects for cosmological analyses from future large photometric SN Ia surveys.},

abstract = {We use three years of data from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) to study the general properties of core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. This is the first such study using the " rolling search " technique which guarantees well-sampled SNLS light curves and good efficiency for supernovae brighter than i ∼ 24. Using host photometric redshifts, we measure the supernova absolute magnitude distribution down to luminosities 4.5 mag fainter than normal SNIa. Using spectroscopy and light-curve fitting to discriminate against SNIa, we find a sample of 117 core-collapse supernova candidates with redshifts z {\textless} 0.4 (median redshift of 0.29) and measure their rate to be larger than the type Ia supernova rate by a factor 4.5 ± 0.8(stat.) ± 0.6(sys.). This corresponds to a core-collapse rate at z = 0.3 of [1.42 ± 0.3(stat.) ± 0.3(sys.)] × 10 −4 yr −1 (h −1 70 Mpc) −3 .},

abstract = {The Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) has produced a high-quality, homogeneous sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) out to redshifts greater than z=1. In its first four years of full operation (to June 2007), the SNLS discovered more than 3000 transient candidates, 373 of which have been confirmed spectroscopically as SNe Ia. Use of these SNe Ia in precision cosmology critically depends on an analysis of the observational biases incurred in the SNLS survey due to the incomplete sampling of the underlying SN Ia population. This paper describes our real-time supernova detection and analysis procedures, and uses detailed Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effects of Malmquist bias and spectroscopic sampling. Such sampling effects are found to become apparent at z{\~{}}0.6, with a significant shift in the average magnitude of the spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia sample towards brighter values for z{\textgreater}0.75. We describe our approach to correct for these selection biases in our three-year SNLS cosmological analysis (SNLS3), and present a breakdown of the systematic uncertainties involved.},

abstract = {We present optical spectra and light curves for three hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae followed by the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO). Time series spectroscopy from a few days after maximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class, with spectra dominated by Ca II, Mg II, Fe II and Si II, which evolve slowly over most of the post-peak photospheric phase. We determine bolometric light curves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy input by magnetar spin-down, 56Ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaque circumstellar shell. We investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of our sample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain the possible mechanisms behind these events. We have followed these events to beyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fading supernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diverse behaviour at this phase. Models powered by radioactivity require unrealistic parameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previous studies. Both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to be viable candidates. A large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phase luminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapid drop in flux. This would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, or that the X-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. The light curve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d after maximum light. We argue that this could result either from multiple shells of circumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of the ejecta.},

abstract = {(ABRIDGED) We show that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are formed within both very young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on the stellar mass and mean star-formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies. Models where the SN Ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass are ruled out with 99{\%} confidence. Our analysis is based on 100 spectroscopically-confirmed SNe Ia, plus 24 photometrically-classified events, all from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and distributed over 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.75. Using multi-band photometry, we estimate stellar masses and SFRs for the SN Ia host galaxies by fitting their broad-band spectral energy distributions with the galaxy spectral synthesis code, PEGASE.2. We show that the SN Ia rate per unit mass is proportional to the specific SFR of the parent galaxies -- more vigorously star-forming galaxies host more SNe Ia per unit stellar mass, broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing SN Ia rate in later-type galaxies seen in the local universe. Following earlier suggestions for a simple "two-component" model approximating the SN Ia rate, we find bivariate linear dependencies of the SN Ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean SFRs of the host systems. We also demonstrate a dependence of distant SN Ia light-curve shapes on star-formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observed locally. Passive galaxies, with no star-formation, preferentially host faster-declining/dimmer SNe Ia, while slower-declining/brighter events are only found in systems with ongoing star-formation. We model the light-curve width distribution in star-forming galaxies as the sum of a young component, and an old component taken from the distribution in non-star-forming galaxies.},

abstract = {Aims: We present the photometric calibration of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) fields. The SNLS aims at measuring the distances to SNe Ia at (0.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 1) using MegaCam, the 1 deg2 imager on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). The uncertainty affecting the photometric calibration of the survey dominates the systematic uncertainty of the key measurement of the survey, namely the dark energy equation of state. The photometric calibration of the SNLS requires obtaining a uniform response across the imager, calibrating the science field stars in each survey band (SDSS-like ugriz bands) with respect to standards with known flux in the same bands, and binding the calibration to the UBVRI Landolt standards used to calibrate the nearby SNe from the literature necessary to produce cosmological constraints. Methods: The spatial non-uniformities of the imager photometric response are mapped using dithered observations of dense stellar fields. Photometric zero-points against Landolt standards are obtained. The linearity of the instrument is studied. Results: We show that the imager filters and photometric response are not uniform and publish correction maps. We present models of the effective passbands of the instrument as a function of the position on the focal plane. We define a natural magnitude system for MegaCam. We show that the systematics affecting the magnitude-to-flux relations can be reduced if we use the spectrophotometric standard star BD +17 4708 instead of Vega as a fundamental flux standard. We publish ugriz catalogs of tertiary standards for all the SNLS fields.

We present and release photometric redshifts for a uniquely large and deep sample of 522286 objects with i'{\_}AB≤ 25 in the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) "Deep Survey" fields D1, D2, D3, and D4, which cover a total effective area of 3.2 °{\^{}}2. Methods: . We use 3241 spectroscopic redshifts with 0 ≤ z ≤ 5 from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) as a calibration and training set to derive these photometric redshifts. Using the "Le Phare" photometric redshift code, we developed a robust calibration method based on an iterative zero-point refinement combined with a template optimisation procedure and the application of a Bayesian approach. This method removes systematic trends in the photometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophic errors (by a factor of 2), a significant improvement over traditional methods. We use our unique spectroscopic sample to present a detailed assessment of the robustness of the photometric redshift sample. Results: . For a sample selected at i'{\_}AB≤ 24, we reach a redshift accuracy of $\sigma$$\Delta$ z/(1+z)=0.029 with $\eta$=3.8{\%} of catastrophic errors ($\eta$ is defined strictly as those objects with |$\Delta$ z|/(1+z) {\textgreater} 0.15). The reliability of our photometric redshifts decreases for faint objects: we find $\sigma$$\Delta$ z/(1+z)=0.025, 0.034 and $\eta$=1.9{\%}, 5.5{\%} for samples selected at i'{\_}AB=17.5-22.5 and 22.5-24 respectively. We find that the photometric redshifts of starburst galaxies are less reliable: although these galaxies represent only 22{\%} of the spectroscopic sample, they are responsible for 50{\%} of the catastrophic errors. An analysis as a function of redshift demonstrates that our photometric redshifts work best in the redshift range 0.2≤ z ≤ 1.5. We find an excellent agreement between the photometric and the VVDS spectroscopic redshift distributions at i'{\_}AB≤ 24. Finally, we compare the redshift distributions of i' selected galaxies on the four CFHTLS deep fields, showing that cosmic variance is still present on fields of 0.7-0.9 deg{\^{}}2. These photometric redshifts are made publicly available at http://terapix.iap.fr (complete ascii catalogues) and http://cencos.oamp.fr/cencos/CFHTLS/ (searchable database interface).},

abstract = {Aims: We present a quantitative study of a new data set of high redshift Type Ia supernovae spectra, observed at the Gemini telescopes during the first 34 months of the Supernova Legacy Survey. During this time 123 supernovae candidates were observed, of which 87 have been identified as SNe Ia at a median redshift of z=0.720. Spectra from the entire second year of the survey and part of the third year (59 total SNe candidates with 46 confirmed SNe Ia) are published here for the first time. The spectroscopic measurements made on this data set are used determine if these distant SNe comprise a population similar to those observed locally. Methods: Rest-frame equivalent width and ejection velocity measurements are made on four spectroscopic features. Corresponding measurements are presented for a set of 167 spectra from 24 low-z SNe Ia from the literature. Results: We show that there exists a sample at high redshift with properties similar to nearby SNe. No significant difference was found between the distributions of measurements at low and high redsift for three of the features. The fourth feature displays a possible difference that should be investigated further. Correlations between Type Ia SNe properties and host galaxy morphology were also found to be similar at low and high z, and within each host galaxy class we see no evidence for redshift-evolution in SN properties. A new correlation between SNe Ia peak magnitude and the equivalent width of SiII absorption is presented. We demonstrate that this correlation reduces the scatter in SNe Ia luminosity distances in a manner consistent with the lightcurve shape-luminosity corrections that are used for Type Ia SNe cosmology. Conclusions: We show that this new sample of SNLS SNe Ia has spectroscopic properties similar to nearby objects. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We present 139 spectra of 124 Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) that were observed at the ESO/VLT during the first three years of the Canada-France-Hawai Telescope (CFHT) Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). This homogeneous data set is used to test for redshift evolution of SNeIa spectra, and will be used in the SNLS 3rd year cosmological analyses. Spectra have been reduced and extracted with a dedicated pipeline that uses photometric information from deep CFHT Legacy Survey (CFHT-LS) reference images to trace, at sub-pixel accuracy, the position of the supernova on the spectrogram as a function of wavelength. It also separates the supernova and its host light in 60{\%} of cases. The identification of the supernova candidates is performed using a spectrophotometric SNIa model. A total of 124 SNeIa, roughly 50{\%} of the overall SNLS spectroscopic sample, have been identified using the ESO/VLT during the first three years of the survey. Their redshifts range from z=0.149 to z=1.031. The average redshift of the sample is z=0.63+/-0.02. This constitutes the largest SNIa spectral set to date in this redshift range. The spectra are presented along with their best-fit spectral SNIa model and a host model where relevant. In the latter case, a host subtracted spectrum is also presented. We produce average spectra for pre-maximum, maximum and post-maximum epochs for both z{\textless}0.5 and z{\textgreater}=0.5 SNeIa. We find that z{\textless}0.5 spectra have deeper intermediate mass element absorptions than z{\textgreater}= 0.5 spectra. The differences with redshift are consistent with the selection of brighter and bluer supernovae at higher redshift.},

abstract = {Near infrared slitless spectroscopy with the Wide Field Camera 3, on board the Hubble Space Telescope, offers a unique opportunity to study low-mass galaxy populations at high redshift (z {\~{}} 1-2). While most high-z surveys are biased toward massive galaxies, we are able to select sources via their emission lines that have very faint continua. We investigate the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass (M sstarf) relation for about 1000 emission line galaxies identified over a wide redshift range of 0.3 {\~{}} z {\~{}} 2.3. We use the H$\alpha$ emission as an accurate SFR indicator and correct the broadband photometry for the strong nebular contribution to derive accurate stellar masses down to M sstarf {\~{}}107 M ☉. We focus here on a subsample of galaxies that show extremely strong emission lines (EELGs) with rest-frame equivalent widths ranging from 200 to 1500 {\AA}. This population consists of outliers to the normal SFR-M sstarf sequence with much higher specific SFRs (10 Gyr–1). While on-sequence galaxies follow continuous star formation processes, EELGs are thought to be caught during an extreme burst of star formation that can double their stellar mass in a period of less than 100 Myr. The contribution of the starburst population to the total star formation density appears to be larger than what has been reported for more massive galaxies in previous studies. In the complete mass range 8.2  log(M sstarf/M ☉) 10 and a SFR lower completeness limit of about 2 M ☉ yr–1 (10 M ☉ yr–1) at z {\~{}} 1 (z {\~{}} 2), we find that starbursts having EWrest(H$\alpha$)  300, 200, and 100 {\AA} contribute up to {\~{}}13{\%}, 18{\%}, and 34{\%}, respectively, to the total SFR of emission-line-selected sample at z {\~{}} 1-2. The comparison with samples of massive galaxies shows an increase in the contribution of starbursts toward lower masses.

Unlike previous work, we include the effects of systematic terms on the empirical light-curve models. The total systematic uncertainty is dominated by calibration terms. We describe how the systematic uncertainties can be reduced with soon to be available improved nearby and intermediate-redshift samples, particularly those calibrated onto USNO/SDSS-like systems.},

We show that the PTF12dam-type supernovae can be explained without a magnetar in a model with a radiative shock in a dense circumstellar envelope that does not require an excessively large explosion energy.},

CSS121015 is one of the more luminous supernova ever found and one of the best observed. The photometric evolution is characterized by a relatively fast rise to maximum ({\~{}}40 days in the SN rest frame), and by a linear post-maximum decline. The light curve shows no sign of a break to an exponential tail. A broad Halpha is first detected at {\~{}} +40 days (rest-frame). Narrow, barely-resolved Balmer and [O III] 5007 A lines, with decreasing strength, are visible along the entire spectral evolution. The spectra are very similar to other super luminous supernovae (SLSNe) with hydrogen in their spectrum, and also to SN 2005gj, sometimes considered a type Ia interacting with H-rich CSM. The spectra are also similar to a subsample of H-deficient SLSNe. We propose that the properties of CSS121015 are consistent with the interaction of the ejecta with a massive, extended, opaque shell, lost by the progenitor decades before the final explosion, although a magnetar powered model cannot be excluded. Based on the similarity of CSS121015 with other SLSNe (with and without H), we suggest that the shocked-shell scenario should be seriously considered as a plausible model for both types of SLSN.},

We present a method for creating model-based template sets given a set of heterogeneous photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data. Our technique, non-negative matrix factorization, is akin to principle component analysis (PCA), except that it is constrained to produce nonnegative templates, it can use a basis set of models (rather than the delta function basis of PCA), and it naturally handles uncertainties, missing data, and heterogeneous data (including broad-band fluxes at various redshifts). The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are intepretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star-formation histories. We present templates fit with this method to data from GALEX, Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and photometry, the Two-Micron All Sky Survey, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey.

Occasionally, a star passing too near a MBH is torn apart by gravitational forces, leading to a bright panchromatic tidal disruption flare (TDF). While the high-energy transient Swift J164449.3+573451 ("Sw 1644+57") initially displayed none of the theoretically anticipated (nor previously observed) TDF characteristics, we show that the observations (Levan et al. 2011) suggest a sudden accretion event onto a central MBH of mass {\~{}}10{\^{}}6-10{\^{}}7 solar masses. We find evidence for a mildly relativistic outflow, jet collimation, and a spectrum characterized by synchrotron and inverse Compton processes; this leads to a natural analogy of Sw 1644+57 with a smaller-scale blazar. The phenomenologically novel Sw 1644+57 thus connects the study of TDFs and active galaxies, opening a new vista on disk-jet interactions in BHs and magnetic field generation and transport in accretion systems.},

The outburst was first detected by Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) in 2011 June as an unknown, long-lived (order of days) gamma-ray transient source.We show that its position is consistent with the nucleus of a faint galaxy forwhich we establish a likely redshift of z = 0.89 based on a single emission line that we interpret as the blended [O II] $\lambda$3727 doublet. At this redshift, the peak X-ray/gamma-ray luminosity exceeded 1047 erg s−1,while a spatially coincident optical transient source had i? ∼22 (Mg∼−21.4 at z=0.89) during early observations, ∼20 d after the Swift trigger. These properties place Swift J1112.2−8238 in a very similar region of parameter space to the two previously identified members of this class, Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+0516. As with those events the high-energy emission shows evidence for variability over the first few days, while late-time observations, almost 3 yr post- outburst, demonstrate that it has nowswitched off. Swift J1112.2−8238 brings the total number of such events observed by Swift to three, interestingly all detected by Swift over a ∼3 month period ({\textless}3 per cent of its total lifetime as of 2015 March).While this suggests the possibility that further examples may be uncovered by detailed searches of the BAT archives, the lack of any prime candidates in the years since 2011 means these events are undoubtedly rare.},

abstract = {Supermassive black holes have powerful gravitational fields with strong gradients that can destroy stars that get too close, producing a bright flare in ultraviolet and X-ray spectral regions from stellar debris that forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The aftermath of this process may have been seen several times over the past two decades in the form of sparsely sampled, slowly fading emission from distant galaxies, but the onset of the stellar disruption event has not hitherto been observed. Here we report observations of a bright X-ray flare from the extragalactic transient Swift J164449.3+573451. This source increased in brightness in the X-ray band by a factor of at least 10,000 since 1990 and by a factor of at least 100 since early 2010. We conclude that we have captured the onset of relativistic jet activity from a supermassive black hole. A companion paper comes to similar conclusions on the basis of radio observations. This event is probably due to the tidal disruption of a star falling into a supermassive black hole, but the detailed behaviour differs from current theoretical models of such events.},

Our photometric-classification method is based on the SN typing technique of Sako et al. (2011), aided by host galaxy redshifts (0.05{\textless}z{\textless}0.55). SNANA simulations of our methodology estimate that we have a SN Ia typing efficiency of 70.8{\%}, with only 3.9{\%} contamination from core-collapse (non-Ia) SNe. We demonstrate that this level of contamination has no effect on our cosmological constraints. We quantify and correct for our selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias) using simulations. When fitting to a flat LambdaCDM cosmological model, we find that our photometric sample alone gives omega{\_}m=0.24+0.07-0.05 (statistical errors only). If we relax the constraint on flatness, then our sample provides competitive joint statistical constraints on omega{\_}m and omega{\_}lambda, comparable to those derived from the spectroscopically-confirmed three-year Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3). Using only our data, the statistics-only result favors an accelerating universe at 99.96{\%} confidence. Assuming a constant wCDM cosmological model, and combining with H0, CMB and LRG data, we obtain w=-0.96+0.10-0.10, omega{\_}m=0.29+0.02-0.02 and omega{\_}k=0.00+0.03-0.02 (statistical errors only), which is competitive with similar spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia analyses. Overall this comparison is re-assuring, considering the lower redshift leverage of the SDSS-II SN sample (z{\textless}0.55) and the lack of spectroscopic confirmation used herein. These results demonstrate the potential of photometrically-classified SNe Ia samples in improving cosmological constraints.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae are destructive explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. Although they are used empirically to measure cosmological distances, the nature of their progenitors remains mysterious. One of the leading progenitor models, called the single degenerate channel, hypothesizes that a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star and the resulting increase in its central pressure and temperature ignites thermonuclear explosion. Here we report observations with the Swift Space Telescope of strong but declining ultraviolet emission from a type Ia supernova within four days of its explosion. This emission is consistent with theoretical expectations of collision between material ejected by the supernova and a companion star, and therefore provides evidence that some type Ia supernovae arise from the single degenerate channel.},

abstract = {We report the discovery by the Swift hard X-ray monitor of the transient source Swift J2058.4+0516 (Sw J2058+05). Our multi-wavelength follow-up campaign uncovered a long-lived (duration {\textgreater}{\~{}} months), luminous X-ray (L{\_}X,iso {\~{}} 3 x 10e47 erg s{\^{}}-1) and radio (v L{\_}v,iso {\~{}} 10e42 erg s{\^{}}-1) counterpart. The associated optical emission, however, from which we measure a redshift of 1.1853, is relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dust extinction in the host galaxy. Based on numerous similarities with the recently discovered GRB 110328A / Swift J164449.3+573451 (Sw J1644+57), we suggest that Sw J2058+05 may be the second member of a new class of relativistic outbursts resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. If so, the relative rarity of these sources implies that either these outflows are extremely narrowly collimated (theta {\textless} 1 deg), or only a small fraction of tidal disruptions generate relativistic ejecta. Analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that the spin of the black hole may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic component. Alternatively, if powered by gas accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus), this would imply that some galaxies can transition from apparent quiescence to a radiatively efficient state of accretion on quite short time scales.},

The observational time and filter fluxes are used as inputs to the network, but since the inputs are agnostic additional data such as host galaxy information can also be included. Using the Supernovae Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC) data, we find that deep networks are capable of learning about light curves, however the performance of the network is highly sensitive to the amount of training data. For a training size of 50$\backslash${\%} of the representational SPCC dataset (around {\$}10{\^{}}4{\$} supernovae) we obtain a type-Ia vs. non-type-Ia classification accuracy of 94.7$\backslash${\%}, an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve AUC of 0.986 and a SPCC figure-of-merit {\$}F{\_}1=0.64{\$}.

By employing bidirectional neural networks we can acquire impressive classification results between supernovae types -I,{\~{}}-II and{\~{}}-III at an accuracy of 90.4$\backslash${\%} and AUC of 0.974. We also apply a pre-trained model to obtain classification probabilities as a function of time, and show it can give early indications of supernovae type.

We apply our models to the observed LCs of the H-rich Super Luminous Supernovae (SLSN-II) SN 2006gy, SN 2006tf, SN 2008am, SN 2008es, CSS100217, the H-poor SLSN-I SN 2005ap, SCP06F6, SN 2007bi, SN 2010gx and SN 2010kd as well as to the interacting SN 2008iy and PTF09uj. Our goal is to determine the dominant mechanism that powers the LCs of these extraordinary events and the physical conditions involved in each case. We also present a comparison of our semi-analytical results with recent results from numerical radiation hydrodynamics calculations in the particular case of SN 2006gy in order to explore the strengths and weaknesses of our models. We find that CS shock heating produced by ejecta-CSM interaction provides a better fit to the LCs of most of the events we examine. We discuss the possibility that collision of supernova ejecta with hydrogen-deficient CSM accounts for some of the hydrogen-deficient SLSNe (SLSN-I) and may be a plausible explanation for the explosion mechanism of SN 2007bi, the pair-instability supernova (PISN) candidate.

While these extremely luminous explosions have been observed from z=0.1 to 1.55, the closest explosions allow more detailed investigations of their host galaxies. We present a detailed analysis of the host galaxy of SN 2010gx (z=0.23), one of the best studied super-luminous type Ic supernovae. The host is a dwarf galaxy (M{\_}g=-17.42+/-0.17) with a high specific star formation rate. It has a remarkably low metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=7.5+/-0.1 dex as determined from the detection of the [OIII] 4363 Angs line. This is the first reliable metallicity determination of a super-luminous stripped-envelope supernova host. We collected deep multi-epoch imaging with Gemini + GMOS between 240-560 days after explosion to search for any sign of radioactive nickel-56, which might provide further insights on the explosion mechanism and the progenitor's nature. We reach griz magnitudes of m{\_}AB{\~{}}26, but do not detect SN 2010gx at these epochs. The limit implies that any nickel-56 production was similar to or below that of SN 1998bw (a luminous type Ic SN that produced around 0.4 M{\_}sun of nickel-56). The low volumetric rates of these supernovae ({\~{}}10{\^{}}-4 of the core-collapse population) could be qualitatively matched if the explosion mechanism requires a combination of low-metallicity (below 0.2 Z{\_}sun), high progenitor mass ({\textgreater}60 M{\_}sun) and high rotation rate (fastest 10{\%} of rotators).},

Here we present new photometry and spectroscopy for PTF12dam from 200-500 days (rest-frame) after peak and a detailed analysis of the host galaxy (SDSS J142446.21+461348.6 at z = 0.107). Using deep templates and image subtraction we show that the full lightcurve can be fit with a magnetar model if escape of high-energy gamma rays is taken into account. The full bolometric lightcurve from -53 to +399 days (with respect to peak) cannot be fit satisfactorily with the pair-instability models.

abstract = {We use a sample of 45 core collapse supernovae detected with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope to derive the core collapse supernova rate in the redshift range 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.3. In redshift bins centered on langzrang = 0.39, langzrang = 0.73, and langzrang = 1.11, we find rates of 3.00+1.28 - 0.94 +1.04 - 0.57, 7.39+1.86 - 1.52 +3.20 - 1.60, and 9.57+3.76 - 2.80 +4.96 - 2.80, respectively, given in units of yr-1 Mpc-3 10-4 h 3 70. The rates have been corrected for host galaxy extinction, including supernovae missed in highly dust-enshrouded environments in infrared bright galaxies. The first errors are statistical while the second ones are the estimated systematic errors. We perform a detailed discussion of possible sources of systematic errors and note that these start to dominate over statistical errors at z {\textgreater} 0.5, emphasizing the need to better control the systematic effects. For example, a better understanding of the amount of dust extinction in the host galaxies and knowledge of the supernova luminosity function, in particular the fraction of faint M {\textgreater}{\~{}} -15 supernovae, is needed to better constrain the rates. When comparing our results with the core collapse supernova rate based on the star formation rate, we find a good agreement, consistent with the supernova rate following the star formation rate, as expected.},

abstract = {We report on the discovery and observations of the extremely luminous optical transient CSS100217:102913+404220 (CSS100217 hereafter). Spectroscopic observations show this transient was coincident with a galaxy at redshift z=0.147, and reached an apparent magnitude of V {\~{}} 16.3. After correcting for foreground Galactic extinction we determine the absolute magnitude to be M{\_}V =-22.7 approximately 45 days after maximum light. Based on our unfiltered optical photometry the peak optical emission was L = 1.3 x 10{\^{}}45 erg s{\^{}}-1, and over a period of 287 rest-frame days had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 1.2 x 10{\^{}}52 erg. Analysis of the pre-outburst SDSS spectrum of the source shows features consistent with a Narrow-line Seyfert1 (NLS1) galaxy. High-resolution HST and Keck followup observations show the event occurred within 150pc of nucleus of the galaxy, suggesting a possible link to the active nuclear region. However, the rapid outburst along with photometric and spectroscopic evolution are much more consistent with a luminous supernova. Line diagnostics suggest that the host galaxy is undergoing significant star formation. We use extensive follow-up of the event along with archival CSS and SDSS data to investigate the three most likely sources of such an event; 1) an extremely luminous supernova; 2) the tidal disruption of a star by the massive nuclear black hole; 3) variability of the central AGN. We find that CSS100217 was likely an extremely luminous type IIn supernova that occurred within range of the narrow-line region of an AGN. We discuss how similar events may have been missed in past supernova surveys because of confusion with AGN activity.},

In order to search for optical transients with timescales of minutes to years, the CRTS analyses data from the Catalina Sky Survey which repeatedly covers twenty six thousand of square degrees on the sky. The CRTS provides a public stream of transients that are bright enough to be followed up using small telescopes. Since the beginning of the survey, all CRTS transients have been made available to astronomers around the world in real-time using HTML tables, RSS feeds and VOEvents. As part of our public outreach program the detections are now also available in KML through Google Sky. The initial discoveries include over 350 unique optical transients rising more than two magnitudes from past measurements. Sixty two of these are classified as supernovae, based on light curves, prior deep imaging and spectroscopic data. Seventy seven are due to cataclysmic variables (only 13 previously known), while an additional 100 transients were too infrequently sampled to distinguish between faint CVs and SNe. The remaining optical transients include AGN, Blazars, high proper motions stars, highly variable stars (such as UV Ceti stars) and transients of an unknown nature. Our results suggest that there is a large population of SNe missed by many current supernova surveys because of selection biases. These objects appear to be associated with faint host galaxies. We also discuss the unexpected discovery of white dwarf binary systems through dramatic eclipses.},

We introduce a new method for removing host galaxy contamination in our spectra, exploiting the comprehensive photometric coverage of the SNLS SNe and their host galaxies, thereby providing the first quantitative view of the UV spectral properties of a large sample of distant SNe Ia. Although the mean SN Ia spectrum has not evolved significantly over the past 40{\%} of cosmic history, precise evolutionary constraints are limited by the absence of a comparable sample of high quality local spectra. Within the high-redshift sample, we discover significant UV spectral variations and exclude dust extinction as the primary cause by examining trends with the optical SN color. Although progenitor metallicity may drive some of these trends, the variations we see are much larger than predicted in recent models and do not follow expected patterns. An interesting new result is a variation seen in the wavelength of selected UV features with phase. We also demonstrate systematic differences in the SN Ia spectral features with SN light curve width in both the UV and the optical. We show that these intrinsic variations could represent a statistical limitation in the future use of high-redshift SNe Ia for precision cosmology. We conclude that further detailed studies are needed, both locally and at moderate redshift where the rest-frame UV can be studied precisely, in order that future missions can confidently be planned to fully exploit SNe Ia as cosmological probes [ABRIDGED].},

abstract = {In performing a Bayesian analysis of astronomical data, two difficult problems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit pronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional MCMC sampling methods. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models, calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally expensive. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling (2004), has greatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and also produces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied successfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee et al. (2006), but their implementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced degeneracies. Shaw et al. (2007), recently introduced a clustered nested sampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from multimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the final evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further increase in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and present three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from distributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies; we also present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on the evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement in sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to toy problems to demonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter estimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian object detection in astronomical datasets.},

abstract = {Bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence to stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models the necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly efficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in the way MultiNest explores the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected by MultiNest, including those previously discarded under the constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We apply this technique to several challenging test problems and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with INS against those from vanilla NS.},

Compared to other long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), GRB 111209A is a clear outlier in the energy-fluence and duration plane. The high-energy prompt emission shows no sign of a strong blackbody component, the signature of a tidal disruption event, or a supernova shock breakout. Given the extreme longevity of this event, and lack of any significant observed supernova signature, we propose that GRB 111209A resulted from the core-collapse of a low-metallicity blue supergiant star. This scenario is favored because of the necessity to supply enough mass to the central engine over a duration of thousands of seconds. Hence, we suggest that GRB 111209A could have more in common with population III stellar explosions, rather than those associated with normal long GRBs.},

abstract = {Observations from the last decade have indicated the existence of a general class of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), in which the peak luminosity exceeds 10{\^{}}{\{}44{\}} erg/s. Here we focus on a subclass of these events, where the light curve is also tens of days wide, so the total radiated energy is order 10{\^{}}{\{}51{\}} erg. If the origin of these SLSNe is a core-collapse-driven explosion of a massive star, then the mechanism which converts the explosion energy into radiation must be very efficient (much more than in typical core collapse SNe, where this efficiency is of order one percent). We examine the scenario where the radiated luminosity is due to efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejected stellar envelope into radiation by interaction with an optically thick, pre-existing circumstellar material (CSM), presumably the product of a steady wind from the progenitor. We base the analysis on a simple, numerically solved, hydrodynamic diffusion model, which allows us to identify the qualitative behavior of the observable light curves, and to relate them to the parameters of the wind. We specifically show that a wide and superluminous supernova requires the mass of the relevant wind material to be comparable to that of ejected material from the exploding progenitor. We find the wind parameters which explain the peak luminosity and width of the bolometric light curves of three particular SLSNe, namely, SN 2005ap, SN 2006gy, and SN 2010gx, and show that they are best fitted with a wind that extends to a radius of order 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}} cm. These results serve as an additional indication that at least some SLSNe are powered by interaction of the ejected material with a steady wind of similar mass.},

abstract = {We present an exhaustive, quantitative comparison of all of the known extinction curves in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) with our understanding of the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The R{\_}V dependent CCM relationship and the sample of extinction curves used to derive this relationship is used to describe the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The ultraviolet portion of the SMC and LMC extinction curves are derived from archival IUE data, except for one new SMC extinction curve which was measured using HST/STIS observations. The optical extinction curves are derived from new (for the SMC) and literature UBVRI photometry (for the LMC). The near-infrared extinction curves are calculated mainly from 2MASS photometry supplemented with DENIS and new JHK photometry. For each extinction curve, we give R{\_}V = A(V)/E(B-V) and N(HI) values which probe the same dust column as the extinction curve. We compare the properties of the SMC and LMC extinction curves with the CCM relationship three different ways: each curve by itself, the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with R{\_}V, and behavior of the extinction curve FM fit parameters with R{\_}V. As has been found previously, we find that a small number of LMC extinction curves are consistent with the CCM relationship, but majority of the LMC and all of the SMC curves do not follow the CCM relationship. For the first time, we find that the CCM relationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all of the LMC and SMC extinction curves. This result strengthens the picture of dust extinction curves exhibit a continuum of properties between those found in the Milky Way and the SMC Bar. (abridged)},

abstract = {A new class of ultra-long-duration (more than 10,000 seconds) $\gamma$-ray bursts has recently been suggested. They may originate in the explosion of stars with much larger radii than those producing normal long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts or in the tidal disruption of a star. No clear supernova has yet been associated with an ultra-long-duration $\gamma$-ray burst. Here we report that a supernova (SN 2011kl) was associated with the ultra-long-duration $\gamma$-ray burst GRB 111209A, at a redshift z of 0.677. This supernova is more than three times more luminous than type Ic supernovae associated with long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts, and its spectrum is distinctly different. The slope of the continuum resembles those of super-luminous supernovae, but extends further down into the rest-frame ultraviolet implying a low metal content. The light curve evolves much more rapidly than those of super-luminous supernovae. This combination of high luminosity and low metal-line opacity cannot be reconciled with typical type Ic supernovae, but can be reproduced by a model where extra energy is injected by a strongly magnetized neutron star (a magnetar), which has also been proposed as the explanation for super-luminous supernovae.},

However, 1E 161348-5055 has an observed period of 6.67 hr, in contrast to magnetars which have a spin period of seconds. Here we describe a simple model which can explain the spin evolution of 1E 161348-5055, as well as other magnetars, from an initial period of milliseconds that would be required for dynamo generation of magnetar-strength magnetic fields. We propose that the key difference between 1E 161348-5055 and other magnetars is the persistence of a remnant disk of small total mass. This disk caused 1E 161348-5055 to undergo ejector and propeller phases in its life, during which strong torques caused a rapid increase of its spin period. By matching its observed spin period and {\~{}}1-3 kyr age, we find that 1E 161348-5055 has the (slightly) highest magnetic field of all known magnetars, with B{\~{}}5x10{\^{}}15 G, and that its disk had a mass of {\~{}}10{\^{}}24 g, comparable to that of the asteroid Ceres.},

The light curves have been constructed using a photometric technique that we call scene modelling, which is described in detail here; the major feature is that supernova brightnesses are extracted from a stack of images without spatial resampling or convolution of the image data. This procedure produces accurate photometry along with accurate estimates of the statistical uncertainty, and can be used to derive photometry taken with multiple telescopes. We discuss various tests of this technique that demonstrate its capabilities.

abstract = {Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. Taken together, the most recent and robust data indicate a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z{\~{}}6, with especially tight constraints for z{\textless}{\~{}}1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms, and derive conservative bands to indicate possible variations from the best fits. Since the z{\textless}{\~{}}1 SFH data are quite precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalisation, to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalisation, we consider the evolution in stellar mass density, metal mass density, and supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalisation is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. Additionally, predictions from the SFH for supernova type Ia rate densities tentatively suggests delay times of {\~{}}3 Gyr. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalisation, we consider the Super-Kamiokande (SK) limit on the electron antineutrino flux from past core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z{\textless}{\~{}}1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from SN events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses ({\textless}{\~{}} 1 solar mass), and we show that recently favoured IMFs are also constrained. In particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We present new techiques for improving the efficiency of supernova (SN) classification at high redshift using 64 candidates observed at Gemini North and South during the first year of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). The SNLS is an ongoing five year project with the goal of measuring the equation of state of Dark Energy by discovering and following over 700 high-redshift SNe Ia using data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We achieve an improvement in the SN Ia spectroscopic confirmation rate: at Gemini 71{\%} of candidates are now confirmed as SNe Ia, compared to 54{\%} using the methods of previous surveys. This is despite the comparatively high redshift of this sample, where the median SN Ia redshift is z=0.81 (0.155 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 1.01). These improvements were realized because we use the unprecedented color coverage and lightcurve sampling of the SNLS to predict whether a candidate is an SN Ia and estimate its redshift, before obtaining a spectrum, using a new technique called the "SN photo-z." In addition, we have improved techniques for galaxy subtraction and SN template chi{\^{}}2 fitting, allowing us to identify candidates even when they are only 15{\%} as bright as the host galaxy. The largest impediment to SN identification is found to be host galaxy contamination of the spectrum -- when the SN was at least as bright as the underlying host galaxy the target was identified more than 90{\%} of the time. However, even SNe on bright host galaxies can be easily identified in good seeing conditions. When the image quality was better than 0.55 arcsec the candidate was identified 88{\%} of the time. Over the five-year course of the survey, using the selection techniques presented here we will be able to add approximately 170 more confirmed SNe Ia than would be possible using previous methods.},

The transient shows significant polarization at both the observed epochs: one 24 days before maximum light in the rest-frame, and the subsequent at 27 days after peak luminosity. Analysis of the Q-U plane suggests the presence of a dominant axis and no physical departure from the main axis at either epoch. The polarization spectrum along the dominant axis is characterized by a strong wavelength dependence and an increase in the signal from the first to the second epoch. We use a Monte Carlo code to demonstrate that these properties are consistent with a simple toy model that adopts an axi-symmetric ellipsoidal configuration for the ejecta. We find that the wavelength dependence of the polarisation is possibly due to a strong wavelength dependence in the line opacity, while the higher level of polarisation at the second epoch is a consequence of the increase in the asphericity of the inner layers of the ejecta or the fact that the photosphere recedes into less spherical layers. The geometry of the superluminous supernova results similar to those of stripped-envelope core collapse SNe connected with GRB, while the overall evolution of the ejecta shape could be consistent with a central engine.},

Photometric imaging of the transients at +50 to +230 days after peak combined with host galaxy subtraction reveals a luminous tail phase for four of these SL-SNe. A high resolution, optical and near infrared spectrum from xshooter provides detection of a broad He I {\$}\backslashlambda{\$}10830 emission line in the spectrum (+50d) of SN2012il, revealing that at least some SL-SNe Ic are not completely helium free.

These $\backslash$ni masses cannot be made consistent with the short diffusion times at peak, and indeed are insufficient to power the peak luminosity.

abstract = {We report the results of a spectroscopic search for Ly$\alpha$ emission from gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies. Based on a well-defined parent sample (the TOUGH sample) of 69 x-ray-selected Swift GRBs, we have targeted the hosts of a subsample of 20 GRBs known from afterglow spectroscopy to be in the redshift range z = 1.8-4.5. We have obtained spectroscopy using the FORS1 instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope to search for the presence of Ly$\alpha$ emission from the host galaxies. We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from 7 out of the 20 hosts, with the typical limiting 3$\sigma$ line flux being 8 × 10-18 erg cm-2 s-1, corresponding to an Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of 6 × 1041 erg s-1 at z = 3. The Ly$\alpha$ luminosities for the seven hosts in which we detect Ly$\alpha$ emission are in the range (0.6-2.3) × 1042 erg s-1, corresponding to star formation rates of 0.6-2.1 M ⊙ yr-1 (not corrected for extinction). The rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EWs) for the seven hosts are in the range 9-40 {\AA}. For 6 of the 13 hosts for which Ly$\alpha$ is not detected, we place fairly strong 3$\sigma$ upper limits on the EW ({\textless}20 {\AA}), while for others the EW is either unconstrained or has a less constraining upper limit. We find that the distribution of Ly$\alpha$ EWs is inconsistent with being drawn from the Ly$\alpha$ EW distribution of bright Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at the 98.3{\%} level, in the sense that the TOUGH hosts on average have larger EWs than bright LBGs. We can exclude an early indication, based on a smaller, heterogeneous sample of pre-Swift GRB hosts, that all GRB hosts are Ly$\alpha$ emitters. We find that the TOUGH hosts on average have lower EWs than the pre-Swift GRB hosts, but the two samples are only inconsistent at the 92{\%} level. The velocity centroid of the Ly$\alpha$ line (where detected) is redshifted by 200-700 km s-1 with respect to the systemic velocity (taken to be the afterglow redshift), similar to what is seen for LBGs, possibly indicating star-formation-driven outflows from the host galaxies. There seems to be a trend between the Ly$\alpha$ EW and the optical to x-ray spectral index of the afterglow ($\beta$OX), hinting that dust plays a role in the observed strength and even presence of Ly$\alpha$ emission. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, as part of program 177.A-0591.},

abstract = {We present the discovery of a plausible super-luminous supernova (SLSN), found in the archival data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82, called PSN 000123+000504. The supernova (SN) peaked at m g {\textless} 19.4 mag in the second half of 2005 September, but was missed by the real-time SN hunt. The observed part of the light curve (17 epochs) showed that the rise to the maximum took over 30 days, while the decline time lasted at least 70 days (observed frame), closely resembling other SLSNe of SN 2007bi type. The spectrum of the host galaxy reveals a redshift of z = 0.281 and the distance modulus of $\mu$ = 40.77 mag. Combining this information with the SDSS photometry, we found the host galaxy to be an LMC-like irregular dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of MB = -18.2 ± 0.2 mag and an oxygen abundance of ; hence, the SN peaked at M g {\textless} -21.3 mag. Our SLSN follows the relation for the most energetic/super-luminous SNe exploding in low-metallicity environments, but we found no clear evidence for SLSNe to explode in low-luminosity (dwarf) galaxies only. The available information on the PSN 000123+000504 light curve suggests the magnetar-powered model as a likely scenario of this event. This SLSN is a new addition to a quickly growing family of super-luminous SNe. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT.The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a fully-automated, wide-field survey aimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. The transient survey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the 48 inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory; colors and light curves for detected transients are obtained with the automated Palomar 60 inch telescope. PTF uses 80{\%} of the 1.2 m and 50{\%} of the 1.5 m telescope time. With an exposure of 60 s the survey reaches a depth of mg′ ≈ 21.3mg′≈21.3 and mR ≈ 20.6mR≈20.6 (5$\sigma$, median seeing). Four major experiments are planned for the five-year project: (1) a 5 day cadence supernova search; (2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 s and 1 day; (3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in Orion; and (4) a 3$\pi$ sr deep H-alpha survey. PTF provides automatic, real-time transient classification and follow-up, as well as a database including every source detected in each frame. This paper summarizes the...},

@article{Kozyreva2015,
abstract = {An increasing number of so-called superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are discovered. It is believed that at least some of them with slowly fading light curves originate in stellar explosions induced by the pair instability mechanism. Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability supernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up to Z=0.006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether PISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light curve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of macroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting observational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN evolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova evolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The greatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an extreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the hydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of chemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric temperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider range of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light curves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two well-observed SLSNe PTF12dam and LSQ12dlf. However, these models' extreme chemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe. Therefore, alternative models such as the magnetar mechanism or wind-interaction may still to be favourable to interpret rapidly rising SLSNe.},

abstract = {Super-luminous supernova (SLSN) are supernovae showing extreme properties in their light-curves: high peak luminosities (more than 10 times brighter than bright SN Ia), and long durations. Several mechanisms have been proposed for SLSN, such as pair instability SN of a massive progenitor, interaction of the ejecta with a massive circumstellar shell, and the dual-shock quark nova (dsQN) model. The dual-shock quark nova model is unique in that it predicts a normal SN event will be seen about 10 days prior to the main SLSN event. The dsQN model is described here and shown that it is consistent with the light curve of the one currently known double-humped SLSN, 2006oz.},

abstract = {We present the first polarimetric observations of a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN). LSQ14mo was observed with VLT/FORS2 at five different epochs in the V band, with the observations starting before maximum light and spanning 26 days in the rest frame (z=0.256). During this period, we do not detect any statistically significant evolution ({\textless} 2{\$}\backslashsigma{\$}) in the Stokes parameters. The average values we obtain, corrected for interstellar polarisation in the Galaxy, are Q = -0.01{\%} ({\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.15{\%}) and U = - 0.50{\%} ({\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.14{\%}). This low polarisation can be entirely due to interstellar polarisation in the SN host galaxy. We conclude that, at least during the period of observations and at the optical depths probed, the photosphere of LSQ14mo does not present significant asymmetries, unlike most lower-luminosity hydrogen-poor SNe Ib/c. Alternatively, it is possible that we may have observed LSQ14mo from a special viewing angle. Supporting spectroscopy and photometry confirm that LSQ14mo is a typical SLSN I. Further studies of the polarisation of Type I SLSNe are required to determine whether the low levels of polarisation are a characteristic of the entire class and to also study the implications for the proposed explosion models.},

abstract = {The discovery of a population of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), with peak luminosities a factor of {\~{}}100 brighter than normal SNe (typically SLSNe have M{\_}V {\textless}-21), has shown an unexpected diversity in core-collapse supernova properties. Numerous models have been postulated for the nature of these events, including a strong interaction of the shockwave with a dense circumstellar environment, a re-energizing of the outflow via a central engine, or an origin in the catastrophic destruction of the star following a loss of pressure due to pair production in an extremely massive stellar core (so-called pair instability supernovae). Here we consider constraints that can be placed on the explosion mechanism of Hydrogen-poor SLSNe (SLSNe-I) via X-ray observations, with XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift, and show that at least one SLSNe-I is likely the brightest X-ray supernovae ever observed, with L{\_}X {\~{}} 10{\^{}}45 ergs/s, {\~{}}150 days after its initial discovery. This is a luminosity 3 orders of magnitude higher than seen in other X-ray supernovae powered via circumstellar interactions. Such high X-ray luminosities are sufficient to ionize the ejecta and markedly reduce the optical depth, making it possible to see deep into the ejecta and any source of emission that resides there. Alternatively, an engine could have powered a moderately relativistic jet external to the ejecta, similar to those seen in gamma-ray bursts. If the detection of X-rays does require an engine it implies that these SNe do create compact objects, and that the stars are not completely destroyed in a pair instability event. Future observations will determine which, if any, of these mechanisms are at play in superluminous supernovae.},

abstract = {We present late-time multi-wavelength observations of Swift J1644+57, suggested to be a relativistic tidal disruption flare (TDF). Our observations extend to {\textgreater}4 years from discovery, and show that 1.4 years after outburst the relativistic jet switched-off on a timescale less than tens of days, corresponding to a power-law decay faster than {\$}t{\^{}}{\{}-70{\}}{\$}. Beyond this point weak X-rays continue to be detected at an approximately constant luminosity of {\$}L{\_}X \backslashsim 5 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}42{\}}{\$} erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, and are marginally inconsistent with a continuing decay of {\$}t{\^{}}{\{}-5/3{\}}{\$}, similar to that seen prior to the switch-off.

The luminosity of the bump is significantly higher than seen in other, non-relativistic TDFs and does not match any re-brightening seen at X-ray or radio wavelengths. Its luminosity, light curve shape and spectrum are broadly similar to those seen in superluminous SNe, although subject to large uncertainties in the correction of the significant host extinction. We discuss these observations in the context of both TDF and massive star origins for Swift J1644+5734 and other candidate relativistic tidal flares.},

abstract = {Variable X-ray and gamma-ray emission is characteristic of the most extreme physical processes in the Universe, and studying the sources of these energetic photons has been a major driver in astronomy for the past 50 years. Here we present multiwavelength observations of a unique gamma-ray selected transient, discovered by Swift, which was accompanied by bright emission across the electromagnetic spectrum, and whose properties are unlike any previously observed source. We pinpoint the event to the center of a small, star-forming galaxy at redshift z=0.3534. Its high-energy emission has lasted much longer than any gamma-ray burst, while its peak luminosity was about 100 times higher than the brightest active galactic nuclei. The association of the outburst with the center of its host galaxy suggests that this phenomenon has its origin in a new, rare mechanism associated with a massive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy.},

abstract = {This is the second paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). In this paper, a complete SN sample is constructed, and the observed (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) luminosity functions (LFs) of SNe are derived. These LFs solve two issues that have plagued previous rate calculations for nearby SNe: the luminosity distribution of SNe and the host-galaxy extinction. We select a volume-limited sample of 175 SNe, collect photometry for every object, and fit a family of light curves to constrain the peak magnitudes and light-curve shapes. The volume-limited LFs show that they are not well represented by a Gaussian distribution. There are notable differences in the LFs for galaxies of different Hubble types (especially for SNe Ia). We derive the observed fractions for the different subclasses in a complete SN sample, and find significant fractions of SNe II-L (10{\%}), IIb (12{\%}), and IIn (9{\%}) in the SN II sample. Furthermore, we derive the LFs and the observed fractions of different SN subclasses in a magnitude-limited survey with different observation intervals, and find that the LFs are enhanced at the high-luminosity end and appear more "standard" with smaller scatter, and that the LFs and fractions of SNe do not change significantly when the observation interval is shorter than 10 days. We also discuss the LFs in different galaxy sizes and inclinations, and for different SN subclasses. Some notable results are ... (abridged).},

abstract = {zCOSMOS is a large-redshift survey that is being undertaken in the COSMOS field using 600 hr of observation with the VIMOS spectrograph on the 8 m VLT. The survey is designed to characterize the environments of COSMOS galaxies from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 Mpc scale of the cosmic web and to produce diagnostic information on galaxies and active galactic nuclei. The zCOSMOS survey consists of two parts: (1) zCOSMOS-bright, a magnitude-limited I -band I AB {\textless} 22.5 sample of about 20,000 galaxies with 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2 covering the whole 1.7 deg 2 COSMOS ACS field, for which the survey parameters at z {\~{}} 0.7 are designed to be directly comparable to those of the 2dFGRS at z {\~{}} 0.1; and (2) zCOSMOS-deep, a survey of approximately 10,000 galaxies selected through color-selection criteria to have 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.0, within the central 1 deg 2 . This paper describes the survey design and the construction of the target catalogs and briefly outlines the observational program and the data pipeline. In the first observing season, spectra of 1303 zCOSMOS-bright targets and 977 zCOSMOS-deep targets have been obtained. These are briefly analyzed to demonstrate the characteristics that may be expected from zCOSMOS, and particularly zCOSMOS-bright, when it is finally completed between 2008 and 2009. The power of combining spectroscopic and photometric redshifts is demonstrated, especially in correctly identifying the emission line in single-line spectra and in determining which of the less reliable spectroscopic redshifts are correct and which are incorrect. These techniques bring the overall success rate in the zCOSMOS-bright so far to almost 90{\%} and to above 97{\%} in the 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8 redshift range. Our zCOSMOS-deep spectra demonstrate the power of our selection techniques to isolate high-redshift galaxies at 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.0 and of VIMOS to measure their redshifts using ultraviolet absorption lines.},

abstract = {Automated photometric supernova classification has become an active area of research in recent years in light of current and upcoming imaging surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, given that spectroscopic confirmation of type for all supernovae discovered will be impossible. Here, we develop a multi-faceted classification pipeline, combining existing and new approaches. Our pipeline consists of two stages: extracting descriptive features from the light curves and classification using a machine learning algorithm. Our feature extraction methods vary from model-dependent techniques, namely SALT2 fits, to more independent techniques fitting parametric models to curves, to a completely model-independent wavelet approach. We cover a range of representative machine learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, artificial neural networks and boosted decision trees (BDTs). We test the pipeline on simulated multi-band DES light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge. Using the commonly used area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic as a metric, we find that the SALT2 fits and the wavelet approach, with the BDTs algorithm, each achieves an AUC of 0.98, where 1 represents perfect classification. We find that a representative training set is essential for good classification, whatever the feature set or algorithm, with implications for spectroscopic follow-up. Importantly, we find that by using either the SALT2 or the wavelet feature sets with a BDT algorithm, accurate classification is possible purely from light curve data, without the need for any redshift information.},

abstract = {We present optical spectroscopy and optical/near-IR photometry of 31 host galaxies of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), including 15 events from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. Our sample spans the redshift range 0.1 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 1.6, and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specific subclass of cosmic explosions. Combining the multi-band photometry and emission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, star formation rates, and metallicities. We find that, as a whole, the hosts of SLSNe are a low-luminosity (langMB rang ≈ -17.3 mag), low stellar mass (langM *rang ≈ 2 × 108 M ⊙) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (langsSFRrang ≈ 2 Gyr-1). The median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 + log (O/H) ≈ 8.35 ≈ 0.45 Z ⊙, although at least one host galaxy has solar metallicity. The host galaxies of H-poor SLSNe are statistically distinct from the hosts of GOODS core-collapse SNe (which cover a similar redshift range), but resemble the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) in terms of stellar mass, SFR, sSFR, and metallicity. This result indicates that the environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either SLSNe or LGRBs are similar, and in particular that SLSNe are more effectively formed in low metallicity environments. We speculate that the key ingredient is large core angular momentum, leading to a rapidly spinning magnetar in SLSNe and an accreting black hole in LGRBs.},

Spectroscopically, PS1-10bzj is similar to the hydrogen-poor SLSNe 2005ap and SCP 06F6, though with a steeper rise and lower peak luminosity (M{\_}bol = -21.4 mag) than previous events. We construct a bolometric light curve, and show that while PS1-10bzj's energetics were less extreme than previous events, its luminosity still cannot be explained by radioactive nickel decay alone. We explore both a magnetar spin-down and circumstellar interaction scenario and find that either can fit the data. PS1-10bzj is located in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South and the host galaxy is imaged in a number of surveys, including with the Hubble Space Telescope. The host is a compact dwarf galaxy (M{\_}B {\~{}} -18 mag, diameter {\textless} 800 pc), with a low stellar mass (M{\_}* {\~{}} 2.4 * 10{\^{}}7 M{\_}sun), young stellar population ($\backslash$tau{\_}* {\~{}} 5 Myr), and a star formation rate of {\~{}} 2-3 M{\_}sun/yr.

abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) rest-frame ultraviolet imaging of the host galaxies of 16 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), including 11 events from the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey. Taking advantage of the superb angular resolution of HST, we characterize the galaxies' morphological properties, sizes and star formation rate (SFR) densities. We determine the supernova (SN) locations within the host galaxies through precise astrometric matching, and measure physical and host-normalized offsets, as well as the SN positions within the cumulative distribution of UV light pixel brightness. We find that the host galaxies of H-poor SLSNe are irregular, compact dwarf galaxies, with a median half-light radius of just 0.9 kpc. The UV-derived SFR densities are high ({\textless}Sigma{\_}SFR{\textgreater} {\~{}} 0.1 M{\_}sun/yr/kpc{\^{}}2), suggesting that SLSNe form in overdense environments. Their locations trace the UV light of their host galaxies, with a distribution intermediate between that of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) (which are strongly clustered on the brightest regions of their hosts) and a uniform distribution (characteristic of normal core-collapse SNe), though cannot be statistically distinguished from either with the current sample size. Taken together, this strengthens the picture that SLSN progenitors require different conditions than those of ordinary core-collapse SNe to form, and that they explode in broadly similar galaxies as do LGRBs. If the tendency for SLSNe to be less clustered on the brightest regions than are LGRBs is confirmed by a larger sample, this would indicate a different, potentially lower-mass progenitor for SLSNe than LRGBs.},

abstract = {The kinetic energy of supernovae (SNe) accompanied by gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) tends to cluster near E52 erg, with 2.E52 erg an upper limit to which no compelling exceptions are found (assuming a certain degree of asphericity), and it is always significantly larger than the intrinsic energy of the GRB themselves (corrected for jet collimation). This energy is strikingly similar to the maximum rotational energy of a neutron star rotating with period 1 ms. It is therefore proposed that all GRBs associated with luminous SNe are produced by magnetars. GRBs that result from black hole formation (collapsars) may not produce luminous SNe. X-ray Flashes (XRFs), which are associated with less energetic SNe, are produced by neutron stars with weaker magnetic field or lower spin.},

This paper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (SNe) within the first year of PS1 MDS data with an aim of discovering new superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). A total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down to a limiting magnitude of M{\_}AB {\~{}} 23.5, of which 76 were classified as Type Ia SNe. There were 57 SNe with complete light curves that are likely core-collapse SNe (CCSNe) or SLSNe and 12 of these have had spectra taken. Of these 12 hostless, non-Type Ia SNe, 7 were SLSNe of Type Ic at redshifts between 0.5-1.4. This illustrates that the discovery rate of Type Ic SLSNe can be maximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal SNe Ia. We present data for two new possible SLSNe; PS1-10pm (z = 1.206) and PS1-10ahf (z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of SLSNe-Ic to be between 3{\^{}}{\{}+3{\}}{\_}{\{}-2{\}} * 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}} and 8{\^{}}{\{}+2{\}}{\_}{\{}-1{\}} * 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}} of the CCSNe rate within 0.3 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 1.4 by applying a Monte-Carlo technique.

abstract = {We present optical photometric and spectroscopic coverage of the superluminous supernova (SLSN) PS1-11ap, discovered with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey at z = 0.524. This intrinsically blue transient rose slowly to reach a peak magnitude of Mu = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 × 1043 erg s-1 before settling on to a relatively shallow gradient of decline. The observed decline is significantly slower than those of the SLSNe-Ic which have been the focus of much recent attention. Spectroscopic similarities with the lower redshift SN2007bi and a decline rate similar to 56Co decay time-scale initially indicated that this transient could be a candidate for a pair instability supernova (PISN) explosion. Overall the transient appears quite similar to SN2007bi and the lower redshift object PTF12dam. The extensive data set, from 30 d before peak to 230 d after, allows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of PISN explosions. We find that the PS1-11ap data do not match these model explosion parameters well, supporting the recent claim that these SNe are not pair instability explosions. We show that PS1-11ap has many features in common with the faster declining SLSNe-Ic, and the light-curve evolution can also be quantitatively explained by the magnetar spin-down model. At a redshift of z = 0.524, the observer-frame optical coverage provides comprehensive rest-frame UV data and allows us to compare it with the SLSNe recently found at high redshifts between z = 2 and 4. While these high-z explosions are still plausible PISN candidates, they match the photometric evolution of PS1-11ap and hence could be counterparts to this lower redshift transient.},

abstract = {We propose that nebular H-alpha emission as detected in the Type Ic superluminous supernova iPTF13ehe stems from matter which is stripped from a companion star when the supernova ejecta collide with it. The temporal evolution, the line broadening, and the overall blueshift of the emission are consistent with this interpretation. We scale the nebular H-alpha luminosity predicted for Type Ia supernovae in single-degenerate systems to derive the stripped mass required to explain the H-alpha luminosity of iPTF13ehe. We find a stripped mass of 0.1 - 0.9 solar masses, assuming that the supernova luminosity is powered by radioactivity or magnetar spin down. Because a central heating source is required to excite the H-alpha emission, an interaction-powered model is not favored for iPTF13ehe if the H-alpha emission is from stripped matter. We derive a companion mass of more than 20 solar masses and a binary separation of less than about 20 companion radii based on the stripping efficiency during the collision, indicating that the supernova progenitor and the companion formed a massive close binary system. If Type Ic superluminous supernovae generally occur in massive close binary systems, the early brightening observed previously in several Type Ic superluminous supernovae may also be due to the collision with a close companion. Observations of nebular hydrogen emission in future Type Ic superluminous supernovae will enable us to test this interpretation.},

abstract = {The origin of super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), especially the source of their huge luminosities, has not been clarified yet. While a strong interaction between SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario, alternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new diagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the others: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light curve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within which the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large radii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it and the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision. Once the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus the Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go out of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in the dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong interaction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission. Eventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the luminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in an SLSN. The possible dip observed in the hydrogen-poor SLSN, 2006oz, could be the first example of this signature and give support to the SN-CSM interaction as the power source of SLSN 2006oz.},

In this process, rotational energy of the magnetar is radiated via magnetic dipole radiation and heats the supernova ejecta. However, if magnetars are highly distorted in their geometric shape, rotational energy is mainly lost as gravitational wave radiation and thus such magnetars cannot power SLSNe. By simply comparing electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission timescales, we constrain upper limits to the ellipticity of magnetars by assuming that they power the observed SLSNe. We find that their ellipticity typically needs to be less than about a few 10 −3 . This indicates that the toroidal magnetic field strengths in these magnetars are typically less than a few 10 16 G so that their distortions remain small. Because light-curve modeling of SLSNe shows that their dipole magnetic field strengths are of the order of 10 14 G, the ratio of poloidal to toroidal magnetic field strengths is found to be larger than ∼ 0.01 in magnetars powering SLSNe.},

abstract = {We show that the diversity in the density slope of the dense wind due to non-steady mass loss can be one way to explain the spectral diversity of Type II luminous supernovae (LSNe). The interaction of SN ejecta and wind surrounding it is considered to be a power source to illuminate LSNe because many LSNe show the wind signature in their spectra (Type IIn LSNe). However, there also exist LSNe without the spectral features caused by the wind (Type IIL LSNe). We show that, even if LSNe are illuminated by the interaction, it is possible that they do not show the narrow spectra from the wind if we take into account of non-steady mass loss of their progenitors. When the shock breakout takes place in the dense wind with the density structure $\backslash$rho$\backslash$propto r{\^{}}{\{}-w{\}}, the ratio of the diffusion timescale in the optically thick region of the wind (td) and the shock propagation timescale of the entire wind after the shock breakout (ts) strongly depends on w. For the case w{\textless}{\~{}}1, both timescales are comparable (td/ts $\backslash$simeq 1) and td/ts gets smaller as w gets larger. For the case td/ts$\backslash$simeq 1, the shock goes through the entire wind just after the light curve (LC) peak and narrow spectral lines from the wind cannot be observed after the LC peak (Type IIL LSNe). If td/ts is much smaller, the shock wave continues to propagate in the wind after the LC peak and unshocked wind remains (Type IIn LSNe). This difference can be obtained only through a careful treatment of the shock breakout condition in a dense wind. The lack of narrow Lorentzian line profiles in Type IIL LSNe before the LC peak can also be explained by the difference in the density slope. Furthermore, we apply our model to Type IIn LSN 2006gy and Type IIL LSN 2008es and find that our model is consistent with the observations.},

abstract = {Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) have a typical duration of {\~{}}30 s, and some of them are associated with hypernovae, such as Type Ic SN 1998bw. Wolf-Rayet stars are the most plausible LGRB progenitors, since the free fall time of the envelope is consistent with the duration, and the natural outcome of the progenitor is a Type Ic SN. While a new population of ultra-long GRBs (ULGRBs), GRB 111209A, GRB 101225A, and GRB 121027A, has a duration of {\~{}}104 s, two of them are accompanied by superluminous-supernova-like (SLSN-like) bumps, which are lesssim 10 times brighter than typical hypernovae. Wolf-Rayet progenitors cannot explain ULGRBs because of durations that are too long and SN-like bumps that are too bright. A blue supergiant (BSG) progenitor model, however, can explain the duration of ULGRBs. Moreover, SLSN-like bumps can be attributed to the so-called cocoon fireball photospheric emissions (CFPEs). Since a large cocoon is inevitably produced during the relativistic jet piercing though the BSG envelope, this component can be smoking gun evidence of the BSG model for ULGRBs. In this paper, we examine u-, g-, r-, i-, and J-band light curves of three ULGRBs and demonstrate that they can be fitted quite well by our BSG model with the appropriate choices of the jet opening angle and the number density of the ambient gas. In addition, we predict that for 121027A, SLSN-like bump could have been observed for {\~{}}20-80 days after the burst. We also propose that some SLSNe might be CFPEs of off-axis ULGRBs without visible prompt emissions.},

abstract = {We use GALEX ultraviolet (UV) and optical integrated photometry of the hosts of seventeen luminous supernovae (LSNe, having peak M{\_}V {\textless} -21) and compare them to a sample of 26,000 galaxies from a cross-match between the SDSS DR4 spectral catalog and GALEX interim release 1.1. We place the LSNe hosts on the galaxy NUV-r versus M{\_}r color magnitude diagram (CMD) with the larger sample to illustrate how extreme they are. The LSN hosts appear to favor low-density regions of the galaxy CMD falling on the blue edge of the blue cloud toward the low luminosity end. From the UV-optical photometry, we estimate the star formation history of the LSN hosts. The hosts have moderately low star formation rates (SFRs) and low stellar masses (M{\_}*) resulting in high specific star formation rates (sSFR). Compared with the larger sample, the LSN hosts occupy low-density regions of a diagram plotting sSFR versus M{\_}* in the area having higher sSFR and lower M{\_}*. This preference for low M{\_}*, high sSFR hosts implies the LSNe are produced by an effect having to do with their local environment. The correlation of mass with metallicity suggests that perhaps wind-driven mass loss is the factor that prevents LSNe from arising in higher-mass, higher-metallicity hosts. The massive progenitors of the LSNe ({\textgreater}100 M{\_}sun), by appearing in low-SFR hosts, are potential tests for theories of the initial mass function that limit the maximum mass of a star based on the SFR.},

abstract = {We assemble a sample of 24 hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe). Parameterizing the light curve shape through rise and decline timescales shows that the two are highly correlated. Magnetar-powered models can reproduce the correlation, with the diversity in rise and decline rates driven by the diffusion timescale. Circumstellar interaction models can exhibit a similar rise-decline relation, but only for a narrow range of densities, which may be problematic for these models. We find that SLSNe are approximately 3.5 magnitudes brighter and have light curves 3 times broader than SNe Ibc, but that the intrinsic shapes are similar. There are a number of SLSNe with particularly broad light curves, possibly indicating two progenitor channels, but statistical tests do not cleanly separate two populations. The general spectral evolution is also presented. Velocities measured from Fe II are similar for SLSNe and SNe Ibc, suggesting that diffusion time differences are dominated by mass or opacity. Flat velocity evolution in most SLSNe suggests a dense shell of ejecta. If opacities in SLSNe are similar to other SNe Ibc, the average ejected mass is higher by a factor 2-3. Assuming {\$}\backslashkappa=0.1\backslash,{\$}cm{\$}{\^{}}2\backslash,{\$}g{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, we estimate a mean (median) SLSN ejecta mass of 10{\$}\backslash,{\$}M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} (6{\$}\backslash,{\$}M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}), with a range of 3-30{\$}\backslash,{\$}M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. Doubling the assumed opacity brings the masses closer to normal SNe Ibc, but with a high-mass tail. The most probable mechanism for generating SLSNe seems to be the core-collapse of a very massive hydrogen-poor star, forming a millisecond magnetar.},

The spectrum and light curve are very similar to slow-declining SLSNe such as PTF12dam. However, detections within {\~{}}1 day after explosion show a bright and relatively fast initial peak, lasting for {\~{}}15 days, prior to the usual slow rise to maximum light. The broader, main peak can be fit with either central engine or circumstellar interaction models. We discuss the implications of the precursor peak in the context of these models. It is too bright and narrow to be explained as a normal 56Ni-powered SN, and we suggest that interaction models may struggle to fit the two peaks simultaneously. We propose that the initial peak may arise from the post-shock cooling of extended stellar material, and reheating by a central engine drives the second peak. In this picture, we show that an explosion energy of {\~{}}2x10{\^{}}{\{}52{\}} erg and a progenitor radius of a few hundred solar radii would be required to power the early emission. The competing engine models involve rapidly spinning magnetars (neutron stars) or fall-back accretion onto a central black hole. The prompt energy required may favour the black hole scenario. The bright initial peak effectively rules out a compact Wolf-Rayet star as a progenitor, since the inferred energies and ejected masses become unphysical.},

abstract = {LSQ14bdq and SN 2006oz are super-luminous, hydrogen-poor, SNe with double-humped light curves. We show that a Quark-Nova (QN; explosive transition of the neutron star to a quark star) occurring in a massive binary, experiencing two Common Envelope (CE) phases, can quantitatively explain the light curves of LSQ14bdq and SN 2006oz. The more massive component (A) explodes first as a normal SN, yielding a Neutron Star which ejects the hydrogen envelope of the companion when the system enters its first CE phase. During the second CE phase, the NS spirals into and inflates the second He-rich CE. In the process it gains mass and triggers a Quark-Nova, outside of the CO core, leaving behind a Quark Star. The first hump in our model is the QN shock re-energizing the expanded He-rich CE. The QN occurs when the He-rich envelope is near maximum size ({\~{}} 1000R{\_}sun) and imparts enough energy to unbind and eject the envelope. Subsequent merging of the Quark Star with the CO core of component B, driven by gravitational radiation, turns the Quark star to a Black Hole. The ensuing Black Hole accretion provides sufficient power for the second brighter and long lasting hump. Our model suggests a possible connection between SLSNe-I and type Ic-BL SNe which occur when the Quark Nova is triggered inside the CO core. We estimate the rate of QNe in massive binaries during the second CE phase to be {\~{}} 5x10{\^{}}(-5) of that of core-collapse SNe.},

We consider X-ray emission from the forward shock of SNe ejecta colliding into an optically-thin CSM shell, derive simple expressions for the X-ray luminosity as a function of the circumstellar shell characteristics, and discuss the different regimes in which the shock will be radiative or adiabatic, and whether the emission will be dominated by free-free radiation or line-cooling. We find that even with normal supernova explosion energies of 10{\^{}}51 erg, there exists CSM shell configurations that can liberate a large fraction of the explosion energy in X-rays, producing unabsorbed X-ray luminosities approaching 10{\^{}}44 erg/s events lasting a few months, or even 10{\^{}}45 erg/s flashes lasting days. Although the large column density of the circumstellar shell can absorb most of the flux from the initial shock, the most luminous events produce hard X-rays that are less susceptible to photoelectric absorption, and can counteract such losses by completely ionizing the intervening material. Regardless, once the shock traverses the entire circumstellar shell, the full luminosity could be available to observers.},

abstract = {Recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group of extremely luminous optical transients. The initial discoveries of SN 2005ap by the Texas Supernova Search and SCP-06F6 in a deep Hubble pencil beam survey were followed by the Palomar Transient Factory confirmation of host redshifts for other similar transients. The transients share the common properties of high optical luminosities (peak magnitudes {\~{}} -21 to -23), blue colors, and a lack of H or He spectral features. The physical mechanism that produces the luminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion to pulsational pair-instability. Here we report the most detailed photometric and spectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (SN 2010gx) detected in the Pan-STARRS 1 sky survey. In common with other transients in this family, early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption lines of O II. However, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type Ic supernova features, showing the characteristic broad Fe II and Si II absorption lines. Detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all SN 2005ap and SCP-06F6 type transients are linked to supernovae Ic. This poses problems in understanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication from late-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56Ni, the broad lightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolution is quite different from typical Ic timescales. The nature of the progenitor stars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.},

abstract = {Absolute magnitudes in the B, V, and I bands are derived for nine well-observed Type Ia supernovae, using host galaxy distances estimated via the surface brightness fluctuations or Tully-Fisher methods. These data indicate that there is a significant intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae, amounting to +/- 0.8 mag in B, +/- 0.6 mag in V, and +/- 0.5 mag in I. Moreover, the absolute magnitudes appear to be tightly correlated with the initial rate of decline of the B light curve, with the slope of the correlation being steepest in B and becoming progressively flatter in the V and I bands. This implies that the intrinsic B - V colors of Type Ia supernovae at maximum light are not identical, with the fastest declining light curves corresponding to the intrinsically reddest events. Certain spectroscopic properties may also be correlated with the initial decline rate. These results are most simply interpreted as evidence for a range of progenitor masses, although variations in the explosion mechanism are also possible. Considerable care must be exercised in employing Type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles, particularly at large redshifts where Malmquist bias could be an important effect.},

abstract = {Extended material at large radii surrounding a supernova can result in a double-peaked light curve. This occurs when the material is sufficiently massive that the supernova shock continues to propagate into it and sufficiently extended that it produces a bright first peak. Such material can be the leftover, low-mass envelope of a star that has been highly stripped, the mass associated with a wind, or perhaps mass surrounding the progenitor due to some type of pre-explosion activity. I summarize the conditions necessary for such a light curve to occur, describe what can be learned about the extended material from the light curve shape, and provide an analytic model for fitting the first peak in these double-peaked supernovae. This is applied to the specific case of a Type Ic super-luminous supernova, LSQ14bdq. The mass in the extended material around this explosion's progenitor is measured to be small, {\~{}}0.3-0.5 Msun. The radius of this material can be {\~{}}500-5000 Rsun, but it is difficult to constrain due to a degeneracy between radius and the supernova's energy. In the future, spectra taken during the first peak will be important for measuring the velocity and composition of the extended material so that this degeneracy can be overcome.},

The Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) will deliver many hundreds of SNIa detections, and well-sampled g'r'i'z' light curves, over the next 5 years. Using these data, we will obtain a precise measurement of the cosmological parameters (Omega{\_}mass, Omega{\_}Lambda); our goal is to determine the cosmological equation of state parameter w to a precision better than +-0.10, and hence test theories for the origin of the universal acceleration. SNLS uses the CFHT MegaCam imager (400 Megapixels, 1 deg{\^{}}2) to image four fields around the sky in 4 filters, with typical time sampling of 3--4 nights. A total of 202 nights of CFHT time has been allocated over the next 5 years for these observations; a large program of followup spectroscopy is now underway at VLT, Gemini, Keck, and Magellan. SNLS has been running since August 2003. There now exist about 330 reliable SN detections with excellent light curves out to beyond redshift 0.9, of which about 80 have been spectroscopically identified as Type Ia's.

abstract = {Supernovae (SNe) are popular tools to explore the cosmological expansion of the Universe owing to their bright peak magnitudes and reasonably high rates; however, even the relatively homogeneous Type Ia supernovae are not intrinsically perfect standard candles. Their absolute peak brightness must be established by corrections that have been largely empirical. Hundreds of SNe are now found every year, shrinking the statistical errors in the cosmological parameters, but most of these distant discoveries do little to further the physical understanding of SNe, which could illuminate unknown systematics. The Texas Supernova Search was not designed to discover the most SNe nor the most distant SNe, but it was instead created to amass a small collection of well-observed nearby SNe with detailed, multi-epoch spectral observations beginning at the earliest possible phases. For the past two years, I have pointed ROTSE-IIIb's 1.85 X 1.85 degree field of view at nearby galaxy clusters and searched thousands of galaxies, covering hundreds of square degrees on the sky, for supernovae. With ToO time on the neighboring 9.2m Hobby-Eberly Telescope, the search has captured SNe spectra at some of the earliest phases ever. In this dissertation I describe the Texas Supernova Search and present the 30 supernovae, 11 novae, and 6 dwarf novae discovered in the first two years of the program.},

The spectra taken about 3 days before and 6 days after maximum light show narrow emission lines (likely originating in the dwarf host) and absorption lines at a redshift of z=0.2832, which puts the peak unfiltered magnitude at -22.7 +/- 0.1 absolute. Broad P-Cygni features corresponding to H-alpha, CIII, NIII, and OIII, are further detected with a photospheric velocity of {\~{}}20,000 km/s. Unlike other highly luminous supernovae such as 2006gy and 2006tf that show slow photometric evolution, the light curve of SN 2005ap indicates a 1-3 week rise to peak followed by a relatively rapid decay. The spectra also lack the distinct emission peaks from moderately broadened (FWHM {\~{}} 2,000 km/s) Balmer lines seen in SN 2006gy and SN 2006tf. We briefly discuss the origin of the extraordinary luminosity from a strong interaction as may be expected from a pair instability eruption or a GRB-like engine encased in a H/He envelope.},

PTF will also discover many new members of known source classes, from cataclysmic variables in their various avatars to supernovae and active galactic nuclei, and will provide important insights into understanding galactic dynamics (through RR Lyrae stars) and the solar system (asteroids and near-Earth objects).

abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H{\_}0), the mass density (Omega{\_}M), the cosmological constant (Omega{\_}Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q{\_}0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t{\_}0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega{\_}M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega{\_}Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega{\_}Lambda=0 and q{\_}0 {\textgreater} 0.},

Deep WFC3 near-IR data (for Y as faint as 27.3, J and H as faint as 27.4 AB mag at 5$\sigma$), as well as deep KS (as faint as 25.5 at 5$\sigma$) Hawk-I band data, provide an exquisite data set with which determine in an unprecedented way the low-mass end of the GSMF, allowing an accurate probe of masses as low as M∗ ≃ 7.6 × 109 M⊙ at z {\~{}} 3. Although the area used is relatively small ({\~{}}33 arcmin2), we found generally good agreement with previous studies on the entire mass range. Our results show that the slope of the faint-end increases with redshift, from $\alpha$ = -1.44 ± 0.03 at z {\~{}} 0.8 to $\alpha$ = -1.86 ± 0.16 at z {\~{}} 3, although indications exist that it does not steepen further between z {\~{}} 3 and z {\~{}} 4. This result is insensitive to any uncertainty in the M∗ parameter. The steepness of the GSMF faint-end solves the well-known disagreement between the stellar mass density (SMD) and the integrated star-formation history at z {\textgreater} 2. However, we confirm that there appears to be an excess of integrated star formation with respect to the SMD at z {\textless} 2, by a factor of {\~{}}2-3. Our comparison of the observations with theoretical predictions shows that the models forecast a greater abundance of low mass galaxies, at least up to z {\~{}} 3, as well as a dearth of massive galaxies at z {\~{}} 4 with respect to the data, and that the predicted SMD is generally overestimated at z ≲ 2.},

abstract = {A number of Type I (hydrogenless) superluminous supernova (SLSN) events have been discovered recently. However, their nature remains debatable. One of the most promising ideas is the shock-interaction mechanism, but only simplified semi-analytical models have been applied so far. We simulate light curves for several Type I SLSN (SLSN-I) models enshrouded by dense, non-hydrogen circumstellar envelopes, using a multi-group radiation hydrodynamics code that predicts not only bolometric, but also multicolor light curves. We demonstrate that the bulk of SLSNe-I including those with relatively narrow light curves like SN 2010gx or broad ones like PTF09cnd can be explained by the interaction of the SN ejecta with he CS envelope, though the range of parameters for these models is rather wide. Moderate explosion energy ({\$}\backslashsim (2 - 4)\backslashcdot 10{\^{}}{\{}51{\}}{\$} ergs) is sufficient to explain both narrow and broad SLSN-I light curves, but ejected mass and envelope mass differ for those two cases. Only 5 to 10 {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} of non-hydrogen material is needed to reproduce the light curve of SN 2010gx, while the best model for PTF09cnd is very massive: it contains almost {\$} 50 M{\_}\backslashodot {\$} in the CS envelope and only {\$} 5 M{\_}\backslashodot {\$} in the ejecta. The CS envelope for each case extends from 10 {\$}R{\_}\backslashodot{\$} to {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}5R{\_}\backslashodot{\$} ({\$}7\backslashcdot 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}} {\$} cm), which is about an order of magnitude larger than typical photospheric radii of standard SNe near the maximum light.

abstract = {We present observational constraints on the nature of dark energy using the Supernova Legacy Survey three year sample (SNLS3) of Guy et al. (2010) and Conley et al. (2011). We use the 472 SNe Ia in this sample, accounting for recently discovered correlations between SN Ia luminosity and host galaxy properties, and include the effects of all identified systematic uncertainties directly in the cosmological fits. Combining the SNLS3 data with the full WMAP7 power spectrum, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey luminous red galaxy power spectrum, and a prior on the Hubble constant H0 from SHOES, in a flat universe we find omega{\_}m=0.269+/-0.015 and w=-1.061+0.069-0.068 -- a 6.5{\%} measure of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w. The statistical and systematic uncertainties are approximately equal, with the systematic uncertainties dominated by the photometric calibration of the SN Ia fluxes -- without these calibration effects, systematics contribute only a {\~{}}2{\%} error in w. When relaxing the assumption of flatness, we find omega{\_}m=0.271+/-0.015, omega{\_}k=-0.002+/-0.006, and w=-1.069+0.091-0.092. Parameterizing the time evolution of w as w(a)=w{\_}0+w{\_}a(1-a), gives w{\_}0=-0.905+/-0.196, w{\_}a=-0.984+1.094-1.097 in a flat universe. All of our results are consistent with a flat, w=-1 universe. The size of the SNLS3 sample allows various tests to be performed with the SNe segregated according to their light curve and host galaxy properties. We find that the cosmological constraints derived from these different sub-samples are consistent. There is evidence that the coefficient, beta, relating SN Ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at {\textgreater}4sigma significance (in addition to the known SN luminosity--host relation); however this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and is currently a sub-dominant systematic.},

abstract = {The observational diversity displayed by various Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) is explored and quantified. In doing so a more coherent picture ascribing the variety of observed SNe IIn types to particular progenitor scenarios is sought. Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) optical and near-infrared light curves and visual-wavelength spectroscopy of the Type IIn SNe 2005kj, 2006aa, 2006bo, 2006qq and 2008fq are presented. Combined with previously published observations of the Type IIn SNe 2005ip and 2006jd (Stritzinger et al. 2012), the full CSP sample is used to derive physical parameters which describe the nature of the interaction between the expanding SN ejecta and the circum-stellar material (CSM). For each SN of our sample we find counterparts, identifying objects similar to SNe 1994W (SN 2006bo), 1998S (SN 2008fq) and 1988Z (SN 2006qq). We present the unprecedented initial u-band plateau of SN 2006aa, and its peculiar late-time luminosity and temperature evolution. For each SN, assuming the CSM was formed by steady winds, mass-loss rates of 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} are derived. Typically wind velocities of a few hundreds km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} are also computed. The CSP SN IIn sample seems to be divided into sub-categories rather than exhibiting a continuum of observational properties. The wind and mass-loss parameters would favor a Luminous Blue Variable progenitor scenario, however the assumptions made to derive those parameters strongly influence the results, and therefore other progenitor channels behind SNe IIn can not be excluded at this time.},

Hydrogen-poor SLSN hosts are often highly star-forming dwarf galaxies and the majority belongs to the class of extreme emission line galaxies hosting young and highly star-forming stellar populations. Here we present a resolved long-slit study of the host of the hydrogen-poor SLSN PTF12dam probing the kpc environment of the SN site to determine the age of the progenitor. The galaxy is a "tadpole" with uniform properties and the SN occurred in a star-forming region in the head of the tadpole. The galaxy experienced a recent star-burst superimposed on an underlying old stellar population. We measure a very young stellar population at the SN site with an age of {\~{}}3 Myr and a metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=8.0 at the SN site but do not observe any WR features.

ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2um . We combine this with HST imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses {\~{}}10{\^{}}9.5 Msol at z {\~{}} 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin{\^{}}2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS) to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z{\textless}=1 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the stellar mass function (SMF), leading to an upturn at masses {\textless}10{\^{}}10 Msol that is not well-described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z {\~{}} 2, and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M*) and slope at the lowest masses (alpha) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/Msol) {\~{}} 10.65 and {\~{}}-1.5 respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. This is not the case for quiescent galaxies: the depth of our imaging allows us to show for the first time significantly more evolution at Log(M/Msol) {\textless} 10.5 than at higher masses. We find that the total mass density (down to 10{\^{}}9 Msol) in star-forming galaxies has increased by a factor of {\~{}}2.2 since z {\~{}} 2.5, whereas in quiescent galaxies it has increased by a factor of {\~{}}12 .},

In light of these difficulties, the diversity of SNe II is not fully understood. Here we present ultraviolet and optical photometry of 12 SNe II monitored by the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT) during 2013-2014, and compare them with previously studied SNe having well-sampled light curves. We explore SN II diversity by searching for correlations between the slope of the linear light-curve decay after maximum light (historically used to divide SNe II into IIL and IIP) and other measured physical properties. While SNe IIL are found to be on average more luminous than SNe IIP, SNe IIL do not appear to synthesize more 56Ni than SNe IIP. Finally, optical nebular spectra obtained for several SNe in our sample are found to be consistent with models of red supergiant progenitors in the 12-16 Msun range. Consequently, SNe IIL appear not to account for the deficit of massive red supergiants as SN II progenitors.},

abstract = {Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) occur almost exclusively in small galaxies (Small/Large Magellanic Cloud (SMC/LMC)-like or smaller), and the few SLSNe observed in larger star-forming galaxies always occur close to the nuclei of their hosts. Another type of peculiar and highly energetic supernovae are the broad-line Type Ic SNe (SN Ic-BL) that are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Also these have a strong preference for occurring in small (SMC/LMC-like or smaller) star-forming galaxies, and in these galaxies LGRBs always occur in the brightest spots. Studies of nearby star-forming galaxies that are similar to the hosts of LGRBs show that these brightest spots are giant H II regions produced by massive dense young star clusters with many hundreds of O- and Wolf-Rayet-type stars. Such dense young clusters are also found in abundance within a few hundred parsecs from the nucleus of larger galaxies like our own. We argue that the SLSNe and the SNe Ic-BL/LGRBs are exclusive products of two types of dynamical interactions in dense young star clusters. In our model the high angular momentum of the collapsing stellar cores required for the engines of an SN Ic-BL results from the post-main-sequence mergers of dynamically produced cluster binaries with almost equal-mass components. The merger produces a critically rotating single helium star with sufficient angular momentum to produce an LGRB; the observed metal aversion of LGRBs is a natural consequence of the model. We argue that, on the other hand, SLSNe could be the products of runaway multiple collisions in dense clusters, and we present (and quantize) plausible scenarios of how the different types of SLSNe can be produced.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We present imaging and spectroscopy of a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN) discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory, iPTF 13ajg. At a redshift of z = 0.7403, derived from narrow absorption lines, iPTF 13ajg peaked at an absolute magnitude of M u, AB = -22.5, one of the most luminous supernovae to date. The observed bolometric peak luminosity of iPTF 13ajg is 3.2 × 1044 erg s-1, while the estimated total radiated energy is 1.3 × 1051 erg. We detect narrow absorption lines of Mg I, Mg II, and Fe II, associated with the cold interstellar medium in the host galaxy, at two different epochs with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope. From Voigt profile fitting, we derive the column densities log N(Mg I) =11.94 ± 0.06, log N(Mg II) =14.7 ± 0.3, and log N(Fe II) =14.25 ± 0.10. These column densities, as well as the Mg I and Mg II equivalent widths of a sample of hydrogen-poor SLSNe taken from the literature, are at the low end of those derived for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) whose progenitors are also thought to be massive stars. This suggests that the environments of hydrogen-poor SLSNe and GRBs are different. From the nondetection of Fe II fine-structure absorption lines, we derive a lower limit on the distance between the supernova and the narrow-line absorbing gas of 50 pc. The neutral gas responsible for the absorption in iPTF 13ajg exhibits a single narrow component with a low velocity width, $\Delta$V = 76 km s-1, indicating a low-mass host galaxy. No host galaxy emission lines are detected, leading to an upper limit on the unobscured star formation rate (SFR) of SFR. Late-time imaging shows the iPTF 13ajg host galaxy to be faint, with g AB 27.0 and R AB ≥ 26.0 mag, corresponding to M B, Vega ≳ -17.7 mag.},

Where possible the objects' redshifts (z) were measured from narrow emission or absorption features in the host galaxy spectrum, otherwise they were measured from the broader supernova features. We present spectra of 68 confirmed or probable SNe Ia from SNLS with redshifts in the range 0.17 $\backslash$leq z $\backslash$leq 1.02. In combination with earlier SNLS Gemini and VLT spectra, we used these new observations to measure pseudo-equivalent widths (EWs) of three spectral features - CaII H{\&}K, SiII and MgII - in 144 objects and compared them to the EWs of low-redshift SNe Ia from a sample drawn from the literature. No signs of changes with z are seen for the CaII H{\&}K and MgII features. Systematically lower EW SiII is seen at high redshift, but this can be explained by a change in demographics of the SNe Ia population within a two-component model combined with an observed correlation between EW SiII and photometric lightcurve stretch.},

Recently, iPTF13ehe challenges these energy-source models, because the spectral analysis shows that 2.5M{\_} of {\^{}}56Ni have been synthesized but are inadequate to power the peak bolometric emission of iPTF13ehe, while the rebrightening of the late-time light-curve (LC) and the H emission lines indicate that the ejecta-CSM interaction must play a key role in powering the late-time LC. Here we propose a triple-energy-source model, in which a magnetar together with some amount ( 2.5M{\_}) of {\^{}}56{\$}Ni may power the early LC of iPTF13ehe while the late-time rebrightening can be quantitatively explained by an ejecta-CSM interaction. Furthermore, we suggest that iPTF13ehe is a genuine core-collapse supernova rather than a pulsational pair-instability supernova candidate.

abstract = {Recently, researches performed by two groups have revealed that the magnetar spin-down energy injection model with full energy trapping can explain the early-time light curves of SN 2010gx, SN 2013dg, LSQ12dlf, SSS120810 and CSS121015, but fails to fit the late-time light curves of these Superluminous Supernovae (SLSNe). These results imply that the original magnetar-powered model is challenged in explaining these SLSNe. Our paper aims to simultaneously explain both the early- and late-time data/upper limits by considering the leakage of hard emissions. We incorporate quantitatively the leakage effect into the original magnetar-powered model and derive a new semi-analytical equation. Comparing the light curves reproduced by our revised magnetar-powered model to the observed data and/or upper limits of these five SLSNe, we found that the late-time light curves reproduced by our semi-analytical equation are in good agreement with the late-time observed data and/or upper limits of SN 2010gx, CSS121015, SN 2013dg and LSQ12dlf and the late-time excess of SSS120810, indicating that the magnetar-powered model might be responsible for these SLSNe and that the gamma ray and X-ray leakage are unavoidable when the hard photons were down-Comptonized to softer photons. To determine the details of the leakage effect and unveil the nature of SLSNe, more high quality bolometric light curves and spectra of SLSNe are required.},

While some 56Ni might be produced in the initial explosion, the peak of the light curve in a Type I supernova would not be directly related to its mass. In fact, the peak luminosity would be most sensitive to the dipole field strength of the magnetar. The tail of the light curve could resemble radioactive decay for some time but, assuming complete trapping of the pulsar emission, would eventually be brighter. Depending on the initial explosion energy, both high and moderate velocities could accompany a very luminous light curve.},

abstract = {The extremely luminous supernova SN 2006gy (ref. 1) challenges the traditional view that the collapse of a stellar core is the only mechanism by which a massive star makes a supernova, because it seems too luminous by more than a factor of ten. Here we report that the brightest supernovae in the modern Universe arise from collisions between shells of matter ejected by massive stars that undergo an interior instability arising from the production of electron-positron pairs. This 'pair instability' leads to explosive burning that is insufficient to unbind the star, but ejects many solar masses of the envelope. After the first explosion, the remaining core contracts and searches for a stable burning state. When the next explosion occurs, several solar masses of material are again ejected, which collide with the earlier ejecta. This collision can radiate 10(50) erg of light, about a factor of ten more than an ordinary supernova. Our model is in good agreement with the observed light curve for SN 2006gy and also shows that some massive stars can produce more than one supernova-like outburst.},

abstract = {iPTF13ehe is a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN) at z=0.3434, with a slow-evolving light curve and spectral features similar to SN2007bi. It rises within (83-148)days (rest-frame) to reach a peak bolometric luminosity of 1.3x{\$}10{\^{}}{\{}44{\}}{\$}erg/s, then decays very slowly at 0.015mag. per day. The measured ejecta velocity is 13000km/s. The inferred explosion characteristics, such as the ejecta mass (67-220{\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}), the total radiative and kinetic energy ({\$}10{\^{}}{\{}51{\}}{\$} {\&} 2x{\$}10{\^{}}{\{}53{\}}{\$}erg respectively), is typical of a slow-evolving H-poor SLSN event. However, the late-time spectrum taken at +251days reveals a Balmer Halpha emission feature with broad and narrow components, which has never been detected before among other H-poor SLSNe. The broad component has a velocity width of {\~{}}4500km/s and has a {\~{}}300km/s blue-ward shift relative to the narrow component. We interpret this broad H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission with luminosity of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2{\$}\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}41{\}}{\$}$\backslash$,erg$\backslash$,s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} as resulting from the interaction between the supernova ejecta and a discrete H-rich shell, located at a distance of {\$}\backslashsim4\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}16{\}}{\$}$\backslash$,cm from the explosion site. This ejecta-CSM interaction causes the rest-frame r-band LC to brighten at late times. The fact that the late-time spectra are not completely absorbed by the shock ionized CSM shell implies that its Thomson scattering optical depth is likely {\textless}1, thus setting upper limits on the CSM mass {\textless}30{\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and the volume number density {\textless}4x{\$}10{\^{}}8cm{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}. Of the existing models, a Pulsational Pair Instability Supernova model can naturally explain the observed 30{\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} H-shell, ejected from a progenitor star with an initial mass of (95-150){\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} about 40 years ago. We estimate that at least {\$}\backslashsim{\$}15$\backslash${\%}$\backslash$ of all SLSNe-I may have late-time Balmer emission lines.},

We quantify evolution in the shape of the mass-metallicity relation as a function of redshift; the mass-metallicity relation flattens at late times. There is an empirical upper limit to the gas-phase oxygen abundance in star-forming galaxies that is independent of redshift. From examination of the mass-metallicity relation and its observed scatter, we show that the flattening at late times is a consequence of evolution in the stellar mass where galaxies enrich to this empirical upper metallicity limit; there is also evolution in the fraction of galaxies at a fixed stellar mass that enrich to this limit. The stellar mass where metallicities begin to saturate is {\~{}}0.7 dex smaller in the local universe than it is at z {\~{}} 0.8.},

We outline the CFHTLenS analysis pipeline, describing how and why every step of the chain from the raw pixel data to the lensing shear and photometric redshift measurement has been revised and improved compared to previous analyses of a subset of the same data. We present a novel method to identify data which contributes a non-negligible contamination to our sample and quantify the required level of calibration for the survey. Through a series of cosmology-insensitive tests we demonstrate the robustness of the resulting cosmic shear signal, presenting a science-ready shear and photometric redshift catalogue for future exploitation.},

abstract = {We present DES14X3taz, a new hydrogen-poor super luminous supernova (SLSN-I) discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova program, with additional photometric data provided by the Survey Using DECam for Superluminous Supernovae (SUDSS). Spectra obtained using OSIRIS on the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) show DES14X3taz is a SLSN-I at z=0.608. Multi-color photometry reveals a double-peaked light curve: a blue and relatively bright initial peak that fades rapidly prior to the slower rise of the main light curve. Our multi-color photometry allows us, for the first time, to show that the initial peak cools from 22,000K to 8,000K over 15 rest-frame days, and is faster and brighter than any published core-collapse supernova, reaching 30{\%} of the bolometric luminosity of the main peak. No physical Nickel powered model can fit this initial peak. We show that a shock-cooling model followed by a magnetar driving the second phase of the light curve can adequately explain the entire light curve of DES14X3taz. Models involving the shock-cooling of extended circumstellar material at a distance of {\~{}}400 solar radii are preferred over the cooling of shock-heated surface layers of a stellar envelope. We compare DES14X3taz to the few double-peaked SLSN-I events in the literature. Although the rise-times and characteristics of these initial peaks differ, there exists the tantalizing possibility that they can be explained by one physical interpretation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.. We present observations of four rapidly rising (t rise ≈ 10 days) transients with peak luminosities between those of supernovae (SNe) and superluminous SNe (M peak ap; -20) - one discovered and followed by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and three by the Supernova Legacy Survey. The light curves resemble those of SN 2011kl, recently shown to be associated with an ultra-long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), though no GRB was seen to accompany our SNe. The rapid rise to a luminous peak places these events in a unique part of SN phase space, challenging standard SN emission mechanisms. Spectra of the PTF event formally classify it as an SN II due to broad H$\alpha$ emission, but an unusual absorption feature, which can be interpreted as either high velocity H$\alpha$ (though deeper than in previously known cases) or Si ii (as seen in SNe Ia), is also observed. We find that existing models of white dwarf detonations, CSM interaction, shock breakout in a wind (or steeper CSM), and magnetar spin down cannot readily explain the observations. We consider the possibility that a "Type 1.5 SN" scenario could be the origin of our events. More detailed models for these kinds of transients and more constraining observations of future such events should help to better determine their nature.},

SN 2015F is a slightly sub-luminous SN Ia with a decline rate of {\$}\backslashDelta m15(B)=1.35 \backslashpm 0.03{\$} mag, placing it in the region between normal and SN 1991bg-like events. Our densely-sampled photometric data place tight constraints on the epoch of first light and form of the early-time light curve. The spectra exhibit photospheric C II {\$}\backslashlambda 6580{\$} absorption until {\$}-4{\$} days, and high-velocity Ca II is particularly strong at {\$}{\textless}-10{\$} days at expansion velocities of {\$}\backslashsimeq{\$}23000$\backslash$kms.

Although unusual in SN Ia spectra, including V II in the modelling significantly improves the spectral fits. Intriguingly, we detect an absorption feature at {\$}\backslashsim{\$}6800 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ that persists until maximum light. Our favoured explanation for this line is photospheric Al II, which has never been claimed before in SNe Ia, although detached high-velocity C II material could also be responsible. In both cases the absorbing material seems to be confined to a relatively narrow region in velocity space. The nucleosynthesis of detectable amounts of Al II would argue against a low-metallicity white dwarf progenitor. We also show that this 6800 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ feature is weakly present in other normal SN Ia events, and common in the SN 1991bg-like sub-class.},

Due to their high peak luminosity, these events can be observed to high redshift (z{\~{}}3), opening up new possibilities to probe the Universe in the deceleration epoch. We describe our methodology for creating mock Hubble diagrams for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the "Search Using DECam for Superluminous Supernovae" (SUDSS) and a sample of SLSNe possible from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), exploring a range of standardisation values for SLSNe. We include uncertainties due to gravitational lensing and marginalise over possible uncertainties in the magnitude scale of the observations (e.g. uncertain absolute peak magnitude, calibration errors). We find that the addition of only {\~{}}100 SLSNe from SUDSS to 3800 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from DES can improve the constraints on w and Omega{\_}m by at least 20{\%} (assuming a flat wCDM universe). Moreover, the combination of DES SNe Ia and 10,000 LSST-like SLSNe can measure Omega{\_}m and w to 2{\%} and 4{\%} respectively. The real power of SLSNe becomes evident when we consider possible temporal variations in w(a), giving possible uncertainties of only 2{\%}, 5{\%} and 14{\%} on Omega{\_}m, w{\_}0 and w{\_}a respectively, from the combination of DES SNe Ia, LSST-like SLSNe and Planck. These errors are competitive with predicted Euclid constraints, indicating a future role for SLSNe for probing the high redshift Universe.},

abstract = {We report results from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SNPCC), a publicly released mix of simulated supernovae (SNe), with types (Ia, Ibc, and II) selected in proportion to their expected rate. The simulation was realized in the griz filters of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) with realistic observing conditions (sky noise, point-spread function and atmospheric transparency) based on years of recorded conditions at the DES site. Simulations of non-Ia type SNe are based on spectroscopically confirmed light curves that include unpublished non-Ia samples donated from the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP), the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II). A spectroscopically confirmed subset was provided for training. We challenged scientists to run their classification algorithms and report a type and photo-z for each SN. Participants from 10 groups contributed 13 entries for the sample that included a host-galaxy photo-z for each SN, and 9 entries for the sample that had no redshift information. Several different classification strategies resulted in similar performance, and for all entries the performance was significantly better for the training subset than for the unconfirmed sample. For the spectroscopically unconfirmed subset, the entry with the highest average figure of merit for classifying SNe{\~{}}Ia has an efficiency of 0.96 and an SN{\~{}}Ia purity of 0.79. As a public resource for the future development of photometric SN classification and photo-z estimators, we have released updated simulations with improvements based on our experience from the SNPCC, added samples corresponding to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the SDSS, and provided the answer keys so that developers can evaluate their own analysis.},

@article{Kessler2009,
abstract = {We describe a general analysis package for supernova (SN) light curves, called SNANA, that contains a simulation, light curve fitter, and cosmology fitter. The software is designed with the primary goal of using SNe Ia as distance indicators for the determination of cosmological parameters, but it can also be used to study efficiencies for analyses of SN rates, estimate contamination from non-Ia SNe, and optimize future surveys. Several SN models are available within the same software architecture, allowing technical features such as K-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models, and thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. New and improved light-curve models can be easily added. The software works with arbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by several collaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. This software is not intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergo continual improvements from the community as more is learned about SNe. Below we give an overview of the SNANA capabilities, as well as some of its limitations. Interested users can find software downloads and more detailed information from the manuals at http://www.sdss.org/supernova/SNANA.html .},
